HULL’ \r\nThe  past few months have witnessed the appearance of three distinct \r\nmodels designed to duplicate one phase or another of adaptive mammalian \r\nbehavior (8, 14, 15, 1): A fourth investigator is approaching the problem \r\nfrom the point of view of mathematical physics (12). Apparently each of \r\nthese projects was carried out entirely in ignorance of the others. While \r\nit is true that this is not the first time that a model intended to parallel \r\nadaptive behavior has been designed (13, l o ) ,  the practically simultaneous \r\nappearance of four or five independent efforts in this direction is not without \r\nsignificance as to the trend of the times. The present article contributes \r\nthe description of still another model to this unique literature. \r\nIt has been pointed out by Baernstein and Hull (1) that a polarizable \r\ncell manifests behavior strikingly similar to certain aspects of the condi- \r\ntioned reflex. T h e  present writers, utilizing this fact, have combined several \r\nsuch cells in a simple manner to form a purely electro-chemical model \r\nparalleling in still greater detail the behavior of the conditioned reflex. \r\nThe wiring diagram of the model is shown in Figure 1. T h e  circles a t  E \r\nrepresent two dry cells. They are connected in series and furnish a po- \r\ntential of 3 volts. L, the responding mechanism, is a Zg-volt flashlight bulb \r\nconnected in series with the battery, E. S,,, which represents the uncon- \r\nditioned stimulus, is a single-pole push button which completes the uncon- \r\nditioned stimulus circuit. T h e  circuits containing the neutral stimuli to be \r\nconditioned consist of the radio “B” storage cells, El, Et, Es, El, and ES \r\nconnected in parallel with the light. S1, S,, St, S,, and SS are single-pole \r\npush buttons placed in series with the corresponding storage cells and con- \r\nnecting each with the responding bulb. Resistances of from 80 to 120 \r\nohms, RI, Ra, R,, and R,, connect the positive plate of each cell to the positive \r\nplate of the adjacent cells. \r\nTHE UNCONDITIONED REACTION \r\nIf S,, alone is pressed, current from battery E will pass through the \r\nfilament of L causing it to become luminous. This represents the uncondi- \r\n‘The model was designed and constructed by the first author.

            "text": "104 CHAPTER 3 \r\ntive stimulation, which Hull called \"goal stimulus\" and designated s0 (Hull, 1931 ). It is \r\na constant accompaniment to the course of action no less than S0 and is the authentic dy­\r\nnamic mechanism that makes the organism \"hormic or purposive,\" as Hull was later to \r\nexpress it (Hull, 1942: 90). 14 \r\nWhat he thought he found in the anticipatory goal reaction that aroused stimulus s0 \r\nwas a physical mechanism that could account for the so-called \"paradox of backward cau­\r\nsation,\" which seemed typical of anticipatory action in purposive behavior. The paradox \r\nlay in the traditional difficulty of explaining how an idea, by definition mental and non­\r\nphysical, could cause a physical action and how the idea, while representing the purpose \r\nor future end to which the action was directed, could cause an action working backward \r\nand thus guiding the subsequent course of the action. Consider the following: \"I am read­\r\ning and it grows dark. I think of turning on the electric light, and without hesitation that \r\naction is performed. The act here described is just as purposive as ifl had deliberated and \r\nplanned out every step in the procedure beforehand.\" 15 It is like witnessing a veritable \r\ninversion of the causal order: the future result of an act precedes the act itself in the chain \r\nof causation. Hence the appeal to the 'final cause' of traditional teleology, which sup­\r\nported a teleological explanation as opposed to a causal one. \r\nIn the next chapter we shall see that this paradox gave rise to several attempts to rec­\r\noncile the teleological and causal explanations until the solution hypothesized at the ad­\r\nvent of cybernetics. To stay with Hull, he attacked vitalist thinkers and what he called \r\npsychologists \"dominated by metaphysical idealism,\" for whom the paradox could be re­\r\nsolved only by appeal to the non-physical principle of fmal causes. The principle of an­\r\nticipatory goal reaction suggested a different solution to Hull. Anticipatory goal reaction \r\ndid not have an instrumental function but a symbolic one, because its sole function was \r\nto produce a goal stimulus, which precedes the goal. So the anticipatory goal reaction \r\nplays the role traditionally ascribed to the ideas of guiding and controlling the sequence \r\nof acts of purposeful behavior. Yet it is a physical mechanism, since it consists of an ac­\r\ntion that was also a stimulus to action, so its effect, like its origin (produced by S0 ), was \r\nphysical and not mental in the sense of metaphysical psychology (Hull, 1931: 502-506). \r\nBut for Hull anticipatory goal reaction was not the sole physical mechanism to play \r\na causal role in the cognitive activity of higher organisms (the role played by \"what in \r\nthe past have been called ideas\"). Indeed, in the case of human beings he granted that it \r\nmight be necessary to add several other principles. His theoretical and experimental work \r\nalike seemed to confirm the automatic nature of more complex forms of anticipatory be-\r\n\"Hull's choice of terms is significant, recause the use of 'hormic' as a synonym for 'purposeful' was made \r\npopular by McDougall (1923a: 72), though in order to stress the irreducibility of purpose to any mechanistic ex­\r\nplanation. But Hull made a point of identifying purpose with the goal stimulus s0 and not with the drive stimulus \r\nS0 , which we saw as the source of a different and more elementary kind of anticipatory rehavior (see section 2 \r\nabove). Mediational hypothetical constructs connected with anticipatory goal response were held in high esteem \r\nby Hull's followers, such as Hobart Mowrer and C. E. Osgood (see especially Mowrer, 1960a, 1960b). Grossrerg \r\n(1982) discussed several difficulties concerning anticipatory goal reaction. See also Chapter 6, section 4. \r\n\"The example comes from Howard Warren, \"A Study of Purpose\" (Warren, 1916: 8), an essay that will re \r\ndiscussed in the next chapter. \r\n",
