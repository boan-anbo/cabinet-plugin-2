The advent of robotics and developments of Hull's simulation method \r\nIn the 1930s a brilliant electrochemical expert, Thomas Ross, designed automata hark­\r\ning back to Hull's robot approach. Ross's automata are mentioned by several designers \r\nof electromechanical animals in the cybernetic age, especially Grey Walter. 18 Ross de­\r\nsigned machines that may well be considered the ancestors of a particular kind of robot, \r\nthe mechanical maze-learner. \r\nRoss got the original inspiration for his robots from a newspaper report on Baern­\r\nstein's 1929 model. This was when Ross got in touch with Hull, to whom he then sub­\r\nmitted what was immediately called a \"thinking machine.\" Ross referred to Hull's ap­\r\nproach when he described his work in an article for Scientific American, \"Machines That \r\nThink,\" from which the photograph in Figure 3.4 is taken (Ross, 1933).19 It was a kind \r\nof mechanical arm powered by an electrical motor that explored five parallel paths in a \r\nkind of vertical maze searching one after the other from entrance to exit. The goal was \r\nto reach the end of the fifth path. When put back at the starting position, the device did \r\nnot repeat the full exploration of the five paths but aimed to traverse the fifth. \r\nVery complicated circuits constituting the memory cells of this primitive robot were \r\nresponsible for its performance. Ross noted that a machine capable of reproducing be­\r\nhavior \"that may truly be described as intelligent\" required much more complex mech­\r\nanisms than his, and this ineluctably entailed the design of increasingly efficient and less \r\ncumbersome memory cells (p. 208).w \r\nThe memory system of another robot that Ross designed was not very sophisticated, \r\nbut its basic mechanism inspired other designers of mechanical maze-learners (see Ca­\r\nhapter 5). The robot was completed in the summer of 1935 in collaboration with the psy­\r\nchologist Stevenson Smith and two technicians from the University of Washington in \r\nSeattle, Byron Sullivan and W.A. Dillman. When it was shown to the public it came to \r\nbe known as the \"robot rat.\" \r\nRoss published a description of this robot a few years later in the Psychological Re­\r\nview (Ross, 1938). The robot was a three-wheeled vehicle a little more than a foot long \r\nand about seven inches wide. The vehicle had a battery-powered motor and ran through \r\na maze consisting of a sequence of twelve 'Y' -shaped choice points, where the right \r\nbranch led to a dead end. When the robot was put at the beginning of the maze for the \r\nfirst time, it explored the entire maze, having been set to try the dead-end right branch \r\nfirst, then go back and try the left branch, and continue its advance. When the robot was \r\nagain put at the beginning of the maze, it went the whole way without 'error,' i.e. avoid­\r\ning all the dead ends. \r\n\" See Chapter 5, section 2. \r\n19 The article was preceded by a note from the Editor of the journal, who introduced the \"purely mechani­\r\ncal device\" described by Ross as the fruit of the growing efforts of psychologists \"to test their suspicion that \r\n[ .. . )thought is[ . .. ] some purely mechanical process, nothing more.\" Referring to the dispute between mech­\r\nanists and vitalists, he warned any reader uninterested in \"philosophical problems such as the nature of thought\" \r\nthat he need not take sides in the dispute based on Ross's machine and consider it simply \"good entertairnnent.\" \r\nAfter all, he argued, no experiment with so-called \"thinking machines\" had yet shown what thought was. \r\n20 Some memory cells are described in Ross (1935). \r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:27:09.738Z","citation":"","pageIndex":125,"uniqueId":"CorDiscovery02","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[CorDiscovery02]] CordeschiR - 2002 - The Discovery of the Artificial - Behavior, Mind and Machines Before and Beyond Cybernetics.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[CorDiscovery02]] CordeschiR - 2002 - The Discovery of the Artificial - Behavior, Mind and Machines Before and Beyond Cybernetics.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:27:09.758Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:09.738Z","cards":[]},"id":"cbde67dc-36b9-4fff-bdbc-b224e67c6be0","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-25T01:36:28.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:09.745Z","text":"stein's 1929 model.

It is \r\na constant accompaniment to the course of action no less than S0 and is the authentic dy­\r\nnamic mechanism that makes the organism \"hormic or purposive,\" as Hull was later to \r\nexpress it (Hull, 1942: 90). 14 \r\nWhat he thought he found in the anticipatory goal reaction that aroused stimulus s0 \r\nwas a physical mechanism that could account for the so-called \"paradox of backward cau­\r\nsation,\" which seemed typical of anticipatory action in purposive behavior. The paradox \r\nlay in the traditional difficulty of explaining how an idea, by definition mental and non­\r\nphysical, could cause a physical action and how the idea, while representing the purpose \r\nor future end to which the action was directed, could cause an action working backward \r\nand thus guiding the subsequent course of the action. Consider the following: \"I am read­\r\ning and it grows dark. I think of turning on the electric light, and without hesitation that \r\naction is performed. The act here described is just as purposive as ifl had deliberated and \r\nplanned out every step in the procedure beforehand.\" 15 It is like witnessing a veritable \r\ninversion of the causal order: the future result of an act precedes the act itself in the chain \r\nof causation. Hence the appeal to the 'final cause' of traditional teleology, which sup­\r\nported a teleological explanation as opposed to a causal one. \r\nIn the next chapter we shall see that this paradox gave rise to several attempts to rec­\r\noncile the teleological and causal explanations until the solution hypothesized at the ad­\r\nvent of cybernetics. To stay with Hull, he attacked vitalist thinkers and what he called \r\npsychologists \"dominated by metaphysical idealism,\" for whom the paradox could be re­\r\nsolved only by appeal to the non-physical principle of fmal causes. The principle of an­\r\nticipatory goal reaction suggested a different solution to Hull. Anticipatory goal reaction \r\ndid not have an instrumental function but a symbolic one, because its sole function was \r\nto produce a goal stimulus, which precedes the goal. So the anticipatory goal reaction \r\nplays the role traditionally ascribed to the ideas of guiding and controlling the sequence \r\nof acts of purposeful behavior. Yet it is a physical mechanism, since it consists of an ac­\r\ntion that was also a stimulus to action, so its effect, like its origin (produced by S0 ), was \r\nphysical and not mental in the sense of metaphysical psychology (Hull, 1931: 502-506). \r\nBut for Hull anticipatory goal reaction was not the sole physical mechanism to play \r\na causal role in the cognitive activity of higher organisms (the role played by \"what in \r\nthe past have been called ideas\"). Indeed, in the case of human beings he granted that it \r\nmight be necessary to add several other principles. His theoretical and experimental work \r\nalike seemed to confirm the automatic nature of more complex forms of anticipatory be-\r\n\"Hull's choice of terms is significant, recause the use of 'hormic' as a synonym for 'purposeful' was made \r\npopular by McDougall (1923a: 72), though in order to stress the irreducibility of purpose to any mechanistic ex­\r\nplanation. But Hull made a point of identifying purpose with the goal stimulus s0 and not with the drive stimulus \r\nS0 , which we saw as the source of a different and more elementary kind of anticipatory rehavior (see section 2 \r\nabove). Mediational hypothetical constructs connected with anticipatory goal response were held in high esteem \r\nby Hull's followers, such as Hobart Mowrer and C. E. Osgood (see especially Mowrer, 1960a, 1960b). Grossrerg \r\n(1982) discussed several difficulties concerning anticipatory goal reaction. See also Chapter 6, section 4. \r\n\"The example comes from Howard Warren, \"A Study of Purpose\" (Warren, 1916: 8), an essay that will re \r\ndiscussed in the next chapter. \r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:27:09.708Z","citation":"","pageIndex":123,"uniqueId":"CorDiscovery02","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[CorDiscovery02]] CordeschiR - 2002 - The Discovery of the Artificial - Behavior, Mind and Machines Before and Beyond Cybernetics.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[CorDiscovery02]] CordeschiR - 2002 - The Discovery of the Artificial - Behavior, Mind and Machines Before and Beyond Cybernetics.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:27:09.720Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:09.708Z","cards":[]},"id":"c134da83-2ee5-4c42-9784-4053f8faf661","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-25T01:34:07.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:09.720Z","text":"ncile the teleological and causal explanations until the solution hypothesized at the ad­\r\nvent of cybernetics.
