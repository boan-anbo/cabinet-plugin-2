William\r\nJames frequently cited Carpenter, for instance, in his\r\n(1890) classic, Principles of Psychology, particularly in\r\nChapter IV, where James included very long excerpts.\r\nHere is a sample of what Carpenter taught, with my\r\nitalicized comments enclosed within brackets. Each of\r\nthese points was elaborated and illustrated at great\r\nlength, so the following is not just a recounting of\r\nisolated aphorisms (from the 1875 edition):\r\n& Habit is all-important and habits grow with exer-\r\ncise–we are “bundles” of habits (Ch. VIII). [Learn-\r\ning, as habit formation, is basic.] “The present is the\r\nresult of the past, so whatever we learn, think, or do\r\nin our youth will come again in later life either as a\r\nNemesis or as an Angel’s visit” (p. 351) [The effects\r\nof learning in childhood are or may be long lasting.]\r\n& Carpenter advised that “Even the infant must not be\r\nbrought out of its bed simply because it is crying”\r\nand he recommended what a century later would be\r\ncalled the “extinguishing” of crying in an infant that\r\ndemands to be held before its nap (p. 354) [The\r\ninfant’s crying is sensitive to consequences.]\r\n& Following Aristotle, Carpenter taught that discipline\r\nmust be established in infancy so that self-discipline\r\nmay later develop. Initial external coercion leads to\r\nthe forming of the personal habit of duty or obliga-\r\ntion (p. 356). [External control is used to prepare for\r\nthe development of self-control.]\r\n& Modeling by older siblings is very important, be-\r\ncause the parents are so different from the child as to\r\nbe unemulated (pp. 357–358).\r\n& Carpenter began Chapter IX with “I am, I ought, I\r\ncan, I will,” but then explained that will power is\r\nreally behavior (habit) and it can be explicitly de-\r\nveloped (pp. 376–377). [Even the most exalted\r\n“mental power” can be trained.]\r\nAlexander Bain\r\nBain was a self-educated Scot, born into poverty, and\r\ncredited with many accomplishments, including writing\r\nmassive works in psychology published in many edi-\r\ntions beginning in 1855. He also founded the journal\r\nMind. One of his major works was The Senses and the\r\nIntellect, published in four editions between 1855 and\r\n1879. It is easy to see the foreshadowing of the bases\r\nfor twentieth-century behaviorism in this sample of\r\nBain’s principles, each of which was elaborated at\r\nlength. Examples are from the third and fourth\r\n(1868, 1879) editions:\r\n& Activity is fundamental and organisms are typically\r\nactive, not passive. This is shown in muscle tonus,\r\nawakening from sleep, and movements of infants\r\nwhen warm and fed (1868, pp. 57–100). [Behavior\r\nwas clearly recognized as the subject matter of psy-\r\nchology even in 1868.]\r\n& According to Bain’s “Law of Diffusion,” stimula-\r\ntion always affects the whole body, as the strings of\r\na harp resonate to ambient vibrations (1868, p. 258).\r\nJames (1890, Ch. 21) gave many examples, includ-\r\ning reactions of the iris and of the anal sphincter in\r\njudgments of beauty. [Watson must have read Bain\r\nor at least James’s (1890) summary. The Law of\r\nDiffusion, without that name, is a theme that runs\r\nthrough all of Watson’s writings.]\r\n& Bain proposed that body responses are involved in\r\n“recollection as suppressed articulation” (1879, pp.\r\n338–339), that the child acts out while describing,\r\nand that our eyes move when we dream. [Also in\r\nagreement with Watson – memory and imagination\r\nare closely bound to muscular activity.]\r\n& The law of effect appeared as “Trial & Error Learn-\r\ning” in 1859. Bain found that human babies remove\r\nneedles that prick them and the lamb learns to better\r\nfind the ewe’s nipple (in Boakes 1984, p. 9). In\r\n1868, Bain gave the example of a baby feeling\r\n“chillness” and moving until it contacts the warm\r\nnurse (pp. 304–305). This leads to learning as a\r\n“process of acquirement.” However, this version of\r\nthe law, developed with Herbert Spencer, relied on\r\npleasures and pains to promote learning. [The Law\r\nof Effect, as Thorndike pointed out, was not new\r\nwhen he promoted it in arguments written after his\r\ngroundbreaking work published in 1898, but\r\nthe hedonist interpretation he briefly held can-\r\nnot withstand criticism and was soon not held\r\nby him or by any behaviorist, though critics\r\noften supposed it was.]\r\n& It is “notorious” that the nurse imitates the child and\r\nnot the other way around. Bain believed that imita-\r\ntion of all kinds is common, but entirely the product\r\nof learning (1868, p. 416). [It took a long time for\r\nthis view to be accepted. But Watson (e.g., Watson\r\n1924, p. 40) thought that imitation was important\r\nand by no means instinctive.]\r\nBEHAVANALYST (2014) 37:1–12 5\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:46.381Z","citation":"","pageIndex":4,"uniqueId":"MalDid14","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[MalDid14]] MaloneJ - 2014 - Did John B.

The child’s mind “riots among coincidences”; the\r\nrepeated manipulation of toys “constrains the mind into certain channels” on the path to\r\nadulthood. Bain was thus a pioneering figure in “child study,” though unlike his followers\r\nG. Stanley Hall and James Mark Baldwin he did not use children as examples of the past or\r\nthe future of the race. Rather, he took play with toys to be an early example of heuristic tool\r\nuse through which the individual interacts with his or her environment.17\r\nBain’s key contribution was his connection between ideal and motor phenomena, and this\r\nis the point that led him to his formulation of “trial and error.” As he put it in The Senses and\r\nthe Intellect: “The grand process of trial and error brings on the first coincidence between a\r\nmovement, and the appearance of that movement in another person; repetition, by consti-\r\ntuting a cohesive link, makes the imitation at last easy.” This, according to Bain, was the root\r\nof both discovering that one’s hands were one’s own and arriving at the most abstract scientific\r\ntheories: “In all difficult operations for purposes or ends,” he concluded, “the rule of ‘trial and\r\nerror’ is the grand and final resort.” In The Emotions and the Will, published in the same year\r\nas the Origin of Species, he attributes the growth of voluntary power to “the primitive course\r\nof trial and error,” through which one learns to associate certain actions with pleasures or\r\npains.18 Far from its origins as a circumscribed arithmetic technique, “trial and error” had\r\nbecome fundamental to the learning process, a spontaneous method in children—and, as we\r\nshall see, animals.\r\n“TRIAL AND ERROR” EVOLVES\r\nEvolutionists soon picked up on this sense of “trial and error.” Responding anonymously to\r\nsome of Darwin’s critics in 1864, Thomas Huxley inverted William Paley’s famous “watch-\r\nmaker” analogy: “an apparatus thoroughly well adapted to a particular purpose might be the\r\nresult of a method of trial and error worked by unintelligent agents.” In place of special\r\ncreation, Huxley argued, Darwin introduced “something which may fairly be termed a\r\nmethod of trial and error.” This idea of evolution-as-method follows both on Darwin’s choice\r\nof metaphor—“natural selection” implied a selector, after all—and, as I have pointed out, on\r\nthe new meaning given to “trial and error” as a more-or-less spontaneous organic process.19\r\nHere, with Huxley’s application, “trial and error” was both a mental metaphor and a natural\r\ndescription. “Evolution” and “experiment” were brought closer together, which paved the way\r\nfor the phrase’s uptake into “comparative psychology” proper. There, “trial and error” com-\r\n17 Bain, Autobiography (cit. n. 14), pp. 113–114; and [Alexander Bain], “On Toys,” Westminster Review, Jan. 1842, 37(1):97–\r\n121, on pp. 105, 100.

Early History of Reinforcement Learning 15\r\nand John Tsitsiklis (1996), who coined the term “neurodynamic programming” to refer\r\nto the combination of dynamic programming and artificial neural networks. Another\r\nterm currently in use is “approximate dynamic programming.” These various approaches\r\nemphasize different aspects of the subject, but they all share with reinforcement learning\r\nan interest in circumventing the classical shortcomings of dynamic programming.\r\nWe consider all of the work in optimal control also to be, in a sense, work in reinforce-\r\nment learning. We define a reinforcement learning method as any effective way of solving\r\nreinforcement learning problems, and it is now clear that these problems are closely\r\nrelated to optimal control problems, particularly stochastic optimal control problems\r\nsuch as those formulated as MDPs. Accordingly, we must consider the solution methods\r\nof optimal control, such as dynamic programming, also to be reinforcement learning\r\nmethods. Because almost all of the conventional methods require complete knowledge\r\nof the system to be controlled, it feels a little unnatural to say that they are part of\r\nreinforcement learning. On the other hand, many dynamic programming algorithms are\r\nincremental and iterative. Like learning methods, they gradually reach the correct answer\r\nthrough successive approximations. As we show in the rest of this book, these similarities\r\nare far more than superficial. The theories and solution methods for the cases of complete\r\nand incomplete knowledge are so closely related that we feel they must be considered\r\ntogether as part of the same subject matter.\r\nLet us return now to the other major thread leading to the modern field of reinforcement\r\nlearning, the thread centered on the idea of trial-and-error learning. We only touch on\r\nthe major points of contact here, taking up this topic in more detail in Section 14.3.\r\nAccording to American psychologist R. S. Woodworth (1938) the idea of trial-and-error\r\nlearning goes as far back as the 1850s to Alexander Bain’s discussion of learning by\r\n“groping and experiment” and more explicitly to the British ethologist and psychologist\r\nConway Lloyd Morgan’s 1894 use of the term to describe his observations of animal\r\nbehavior. Perhaps the first to succinctly express the essence of trial-and-error learning as\r\na principle of learning was Edward Thorndike:\r\nOf several responses made to the same situation, those which are accompanied\r\nor closely followed by satisfaction to the animal will, other things being\r\nequal, be more firmly connected with the situation, so that, when it recurs,\r\nthey will be more likely to recur; those which are accompanied or closely\r\nfollowed by discomfort to the animal will, other things being equal, have their\r\nconnections with that situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, they will\r\nbe less likely to occur. The greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the greater\r\nthe strengthening or weakening of the bond. (Thorndike, 1911, p. 244)\r\nThorndike called this the “Law of Effect” because it describes the effect of reinforcing\r\nevents on the tendency to select actions. Thorndike later modified the law to better\r\naccount for subsequent data on animal learning (such as differences between the effects\r\nof reward and punishment), and the law in its various forms has generated considerable\r\ncontroversy among learning theorists (e.g., see Gallistel, 2005; Herrnstein, 1970; Kimble,\r\n1961, 1967; Mazur, 1994). Despite this, the Law of Effect—in one form or another—is\r\nwidely regarded as a basic principle underlying much behavior (e.g., Hilgard and Bower,\r\n1975; Dennett, 1978; Campbell, 1960; Cziko, 1995).

F. Skinner (1938).\r\nThe term “reinforcement” in the context of animal learning came into use well after\r\nThorndike’s expression of the Law of Effect, first appearing in this context (to the best of\r\nour knowledge) in the 1927 English translation of Pavlov’s monograph on conditioned\r\nreflexes. Pavlov described reinforcement as the strengthening of a pattern of behavior due\r\nto an animal receiving a stimulus—a reinforcer—in an appropriate temporal relationship\r\nwith another stimulus or with a response. Some psychologists extended the idea of\r\nreinforcement to include weakening as well as strengthening of behavior, and extended\r\nthe idea of a reinforcer to include possibly the omission or termination of stimulus. To\r\nbe considered reinforcer, the strengthening or weakening must persist after the reinforcer\r\nis withdrawn; a stimulus that merely attracts an animal’s attention or that energizes its\r\nbehavior without producing lasting changes would not be considered a reinforcer.\r\nThe idea of implementing trial-and-error learning in a computer appeared among the\r\nearliest thoughts about the possibility of artificial intelligence. In a 1948 report, Alan\r\nTuring described a design for a “pleasure-pain system” that worked along the lines of the\r\nLaw of Effect:\r\nWhen a configuration is reached for which the action is undetermined, a\r\nrandom choice for the missing data is made and the appropriate entry is made\r\nin the description, tentatively, and is applied. When a pain stimulus occurs\r\nall tentative entries are cancelled, and when a pleasure stimulus occurs they\r\nare all made permanent. (Turing, 1948)\r\nMany ingenious electro-mechanical machines were constructed that demonstrated trial-\r\nand-error learning. The earliest may have been a machine built by Thomas Ross (1933)\r\nthat was able to find its way through a simple maze and remember the path through\r\nthe settings of switches. In 1951 W. Grey Walter built a version of his “mechanical\r\ntortoise” (Walter, 1950) capable of a simple form of learning. In 1952 Claude Shannon\r\ndemonstrated a maze-running mouse named Theseus that used trial and error to find\r\nits way through a maze, with the maze itself remembering the successful directions\r\nvia magnets and relays under its floor (see also Shannon, 1951). J. A. Deutsch (1954)\r\ndescribed a maze-solving machine based on his behavior theory (Deutsch, 1953) that\r\nhas some properties in common with model-based reinforcement learning (Chapter 8).\r\nIn his Ph.D. dissertation, Marvin Minsky (1954) discussed computational models of\r\nreinforcement learning and described his construction of an analog machine composed of\r\ncomponents he called SNARCs (Stochastic Neural-Analog Reinforcement Calculators)\r\nmeant to resemble modifiable synaptic connections in the brain (Chapter 15). The\r\nweb site cyberneticzoo.com contains a wealth of information on these and many other\r\nelectro-mechanical learning machines.\r\nBuilding electro-mechanical learning machines gave way to programming digital com-\r\nputers to perform various types of learning, some of which implemented trial-and-error\r\nlearning. Farley and Clark (1954) described a digital simulation of a neural-network\r\nlearning machine that learned by trial and error. But their interests soon shifted from\r\ntrial-and-error learning to generalization and pattern recognition, that is, from reinforce-\r\nment learning to supervised learning (Clark and Farley, 1955).

Learning refers to long-term changes-of the organism pro­\r\nduced by practice. As we have just seen, the products of learning are \r\ncarried with the organism on a fairly permanent basis and are available \r\nas a basis for action as the occasion demands. Performance, on the other \r\nhand, refers to just this translation of learning into behavior. The level \r\nof performance depends upon relatively short-terra factors such as moti­\r\nvation, the existence of appropriate environmental circumstances, and \r\nfatigue. The implicit assumption made by most writers and the explicit \r\none made by Hul l (1943) is that learning sets an upper limit to perform­\r\nance. Depending upon temporary conditions, therefore, performance may \r\nprovide a relatively accurate or inaccurate index of learning. This last \r\npoint raises a difficult question for the psychologist interested in learning. \r\nAs we have seen, learning is an intervening variable, an unobservable. As \r\nsuch we recognize it and gauge its strength through its symptoms in \r\nperformance. But, as we have also seen, performance may be a good in­\r\ndicator of learning or a poor one, depending upon other factors. Thus, to \r\narrive at a detailed and quantitative knowledge of learning it is necessary \r\nto study its progress under conditions where these other factors are opti­\r\nmal, or where their effect is exactly known. Recent years have seen a con­\r\nsiderable advance toward the realization of both of these possibilities. \r\n2. The Empirical Law of Effect. Tuming now to the second problem \r\nassociated with the factual definitions of learning, a careful rereading of \r\nour sample definitions will reveal that none of them distinguishes ade­\r\nquately between learning and the loss of learning, or extinction,^ which \r\nalso depends on practice. The point is that practice alone does not produce \r\nlearning, but only fatigue or extinction. In order to insure the occurrence \r\nof leaming, it is necessary to employ, in addition, the operation of rein­\r\nforcement.

The ques-\r\n' Tolman, who was chiefly responsible for promoting this distinction, gave it its \r\nclearest expression from his theoretical point of view in his paper on \"performance \r\nvectors\" (1955). In HuU's theory (habit) is the learning concept; BER {excita­\r\ntory potential) is the major performance concept. Skinner (1938), at one time at \r\nleast, made a similar distinction, with reflex reserve, representing a learning construct \r\nand reflex strength a performance construct. \r\n' Technical terms presented without definition in the text are defined in the glossary \r\nat the end of the book. \r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:38:29.153Z","citation":"","pageIndex":4,"uniqueId":"HMDefinition61","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[HMDefinition61]] HilgardE, MarquisD - 1961 - The definition of learning.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[HMDefinition61]] HilgardE, MarquisD - 1961 - The definition of learning.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:38:29.168Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:38:29.153Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"521cff5f-71dd-4abc-8986-6b06c92ad2fb","extra":"","modified":"2022-06-11T16:01:18.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:38:29.336Z","text":"The Law of Effect is that: Of several responses made to the same situation, those \r\nwhich are accompanied or closely followed by satisfaction to the animal will, \r\nother things being equal, be more firmly connected with the situation, so that, \r\nwhen it recurs, they will be more likely to recur; those which are accompanied or \r\nclosely followed by discomfort to the animal will, other things being equal, have \r\ntheir connections with that situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, they will \r\nbe less likely to occur.

Early History of Reinforcement Learning 17\r\nof confusion about the relationship between these types of learning. Many researchers\r\nseemed to believe that they were studying reinforcement learning when they were actually\r\nstudying supervised learning. For example, artificial neural network pioneers such as\r\nRosenblatt (1962) and Widrow and Hoff (1960) were clearly motivated by reinforcement\r\nlearning—they used the language of rewards and punishments—but the systems they\r\nstudied were supervised learning systems suitable for pattern recognition and perceptual\r\nlearning. Even today, some researchers and textbooks minimize or blur the distinction\r\nbetween these types of learning. For example, some artificial neural network textbooks\r\nhave used the term “trial-and-error” to describe networks that learn from training exam-\r\nples. This is an understandable confusion because these networks use error information\r\nto update connection weights, but this misses the essential character of trial-and-error\r\nlearning as selecting actions on the basis of evaluative feedback that does not rely on\r\nknowledge of what the correct action should be.\r\nPartly as a result of these confusions, research into genuine trial-and-error learning\r\nbecame rare in the 1960s and 1970s, although there were notable exceptions. In the 1960s\r\nthe terms “reinforcement” and “reinforcement learning” were used in the engineering\r\nliterature for the first time to describe engineering uses of trial-and-error learning (e.g.,\r\nWaltz and Fu, 1965; Mendel, 1966; Fu, 1970; Mendel and McClaren, 1970). Particularly\r\ninfluential was Minsky’s paper “Steps Toward Artificial Intelligence” (Minsky, 1961),\r\nwhich discussed several issues relevant to trial-and-error learning, including prediction,\r\nexpectation, and what he called the basic credit-assignment problem for complex rein-\r\nforcement learning systems: How do you distribute credit for success among the many\r\ndecisions that may have been involved in producing it? All of the methods we discuss in\r\nthis book are, in a sense, directed toward solving this problem. Minsky’s paper is well\r\nworth reading today.\r\nIn the next few paragraphs we discuss some of the other exceptions and partial\r\nexceptions to the relative neglect of computational and theoretical study of genuine\r\ntrial-and-error learning in the 1960s and 1970s.\r\nOne exception was the work of the New Zealand researcher John Andreae, who\r\ndeveloped a system called STeLLA that learned by trial and error in interaction with\r\nits environment. This system included an internal model of the world and, later, an\r\n“internal monologue” to deal with problems of hidden state (Andreae, 1963, 1969a,b).\r\nAndreae’s later work (1977) placed more emphasis on learning from a teacher, but still\r\nincluded learning by trial and error, with the generation of novel events being one of\r\nthe system’s goals. A feature of this work was a “leakback process,” elaborated more\r\nfully in Andreae (1998), that implemented a credit-assignment mechanism similar to the\r\nbacking-up update operations that we describe. Unfortunately, his pioneering research\r\nwas not well known and did not greatly impact subsequent reinforcement learning research.\r\nRecent summaries are available (Andreae, 2017a,b).\r\nMore influential was the work of Donald Michie.

Cowles, Yale University\r\nAbstract: Like so many things, “trial and error” has a history. The term first emerged\r\nas the name for a technique in eighteenth-century mathematics pedagogy. In the\r\nnineteenth century, psychologists and biologists transformed “trial and error” from a\r\nmathematical tool into a developmental theory, one that could explain both the\r\nlearning mind and life on earth. “Trial and error” can thus be seen as a case of the\r\nlarger process whereby the tools we use to explain the world do not just influence but\r\nin many ways become our explanations—a process that the psychologist Gerd Giger-\r\nenzer has called the “tools-to-theories” heuristic. This essay uses Gigerenzer’s concept\r\nto frame the evolution of “trial and error.” By the end, it suggests how the historical\r\nrelationship between tools and theories prompts a reconsideration of the terms and\r\nassumptions historians of science use in their own work.\r\nT rial and error travel together. Trying invites failing; errors follow attempts. This symbiosis\r\nis captured in the career of the phrase “trial and error,” which in the nineteenth century\r\ncame to stand for a general give-and-take process characteristic of a whole range of phenom-\r\nena. Today, we think nothing of using the same phrase to describe scientists testing hypoth-\r\neses, children learning to spell, and rats solving puzzles, not to mention computerized search,\r\nimmune system response, and public policy interventions. All are—or can be—pursued by\r\nthe method of “trial and error.”1 However, this was not always the case. Before the Victorian\r\nperiod, “trial and error” had a much more restricted meaning in mathematics and pedagogy.\r\nBeginning around 1850, this began to change. The burgeoning fields of scientific psychology\r\nand evolutionary biology gave new meaning to “trial and error”: as both a theory of learning\r\nand an account of transmutation, the process came to seem both haphazard and bounded.\r\nThis sense of “trial and error” soon took hold in a range of fields and among the wider public.\r\nSection of the History of Medicine and Program in the History of Science and Medicine, Yale University, 333 Cedar Street, New\r\nHaven, Connecticut 06520; henry.cowles@yale.edu.

At its heart, it is a story\r\nabout reasoning and its limits. The story plays out in two—or, perhaps, three—keys. First,\r\nthere is the sense in which early theorists of “trial and error” were describing limited\r\ncognition. Their view of the mind as piecemeal and adaptive rose to challenge orthodoxies of\r\ncertitude. Of course, this sense of “trial and error” did not arise on its own—theories never do.\r\nBiologists and psychologists wielded the phrase in particular ways that placed bounds on their\r\nown efforts in turn. This is bounded rationality in a second key: the history of “trial and error”\r\nexemplifies what the psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer has called the “tools-to-theories” heuristic,\r\nto which I return below. My third, provisional key is more reflexive. If theorists of bounded\r\nrationality (broadly defined) are themselves bounded in ways that are patterned and explica-\r\nble, then it stands to reason that their historians are too. At this essay’s end, I suggest a few ways\r\nin which the history of bounded rationality prompts us to take stock of our own limits.\r\nThroughout, I aim to dissolve distinctions—between knowledge and action, or theory and\r\npractice—that have been tacitly endorsed by our historiographical divisions for too long.\r\nFROM TOOL TO THEORY\r\nIf “to err is human,” then to try is, too. But this was not always the case. Prior to the Victorian\r\nperiod, “trial and error” was a mathematical tool. The term first emerged in the eighteenth\r\ncentury as a synonym for an ancient arithmetic approach known as the “Rule of Position,” the\r\n“Rule of False Position,” or simply the “Rule of False.” The rule worked, according to an\r\narithmetic manual from 1764, by taking “a supposition of false numbers as if they were true\r\nones,” deriving an outcome, comparing that outcome to the desired one, and, via a ratio,\r\ncomputing the “true” number in a single step.2 Far from our current meaning of “trial and\r\nerror”—as a somewhat haphazard system of guess-and-check—the “Rule of False” was both\r\ncertain and limited, of use only on linear problems in which variables were defined and an\r\nanswer was assured. This worked perfectly well in a pedagogical context, and the term “trial\r\nand error” began to appear in astronomical, mathematical, and mechanics textbooks in the\r\nmid-eighteenth century.3\r\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, the phrase “trial and error” could be found in two new\r\ncontexts, often with scare quotes highlighting its novelty. These contexts were psychology and\r\nevolutionary theory, and the simultaneity of the phrase’s appearance there was no accident. As\r\nI have argued elsewhere, theories rooting scientific method in the human mind—theories\r\nauthored by figures such as John Herschel, William Whewell, and John Stuart Mill—had\r\nhelped to frame the early evolutionary ideas of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, among\r\nothers.4 Once evolutionary theories gained traction, implications for the study of mind and\r\n2 Charles Hutton, The School-Master’s Guide; or, A Complete System of Practical Arithmetic, Adapted to the Use of Schools\r\n(Newcastle upon Tyne: J.

Seizing on the best way to carry an\r\nunbalanced stick, Tony “was solving in a practical way a problem in mechanics”—not\r\nthrough reasoning, but through “trial and error.” The same was true even of Tony’s ability to\r\nopen a latched gate: a “relation between means and end did not appear to take form in his\r\nmind,” wrote Morgan: it was “trial and error,” but no higher connections were made.22\r\nMorgan’s observations spurred another psychologist, Edward Thorndike, to conduct his\r\nown experiments on animal reasoning, the methods and results of which would shape the\r\nfield of comparative psychology for much of the twentieth century.

Efforts to define\r\nmental functions in humans and animals were always, by necessity, exercises in bounding\r\nrationality, in marking who—or what—was capable of scientific work. As “trial and error”\r\ncrystallized into a general theory of learning in the late nineteenth century, it was pressed into\r\nservice as both a mark of similarity and an emblem of difference between human and\r\nnonhuman cognition. Scientists, like rats, learn from their mistakes. Indeed, the willingness\r\nto err—as the corollary of the willingness to try—soon stood at the center of debates over the\r\ndemarcation of science from nonscience. Karl Popper’s famous principle of “falsifiability” is,\r\non this reading, simply the logical application of the same insight that underlies the history\r\nof “trial and error.” New knowledge, for Popper, emerges the same way “as something new\r\nemerges biologically; the exact same way as mutations occur.”29 While Popper famously\r\nrejected psychological accounts of scientific discovery, the history of “trial and error” reminds\r\nus of the centrality of a certain view of cognition to subsequent philosophies of science.30\r\nIn the end, mistakes may be the scientist’s best friend.31 Donna Haraway made this point\r\ndecades ago, in a typically incisive footnote on the work of Bruno Latour. Summarizing the\r\ncentral point of The Pasteurization of France, Haraway dubbed the laboratory “that great\r\nmachine for making significant mistakes faster than anyone else can, and so gaining world-\r\nchanging power.” In the history of “trial and error,” we see how a peculiarly modern tool—the\r\nerror, reconceived as a necessary step on the path to knowledge—was transformed into a\r\ntheory of how both the individual mind adapts and scientific progress is made. The applica-\r\ntion of such theories in a range of fields helps naturalize them, so much so that we sometimes\r\nlose sight of their contingent origins. As a result, “trial and error” may now be one of the\r\n“metaphors we live by,” a tool drawn from a particular pedagogical context that continues to\r\nstructure how science is done, how history is written, and how we understand our own limited\r\ncapacities.32 In the transit from tool to theory, what is useful quickly becomes what is—utility\r\ninscribed as ontology.\r\nBy way of conclusion, I want to turn briefly to the third, reflexive key to which I gestured\r\nearly on. It is too often forgotten that Haraway’s essay on “situated knowledges,” from which\r\nI quoted in the preceding paragraph, is a reference—conscious or otherwise—to an essay\r\nwritten a half-century prior. That essay, C. Wright Mills’s “Situated Actions and Vocabularies\r\n28 Small, “Experimental Study of the Mental Processes of the Rat, II,” p. 209; and C.

Nissen proposed that\r\nexploration itself should be considered “a dynamic form of behavior akin to the hun-\r\nger, thirst, sex, and maternal drives.”93 When he became director of the Yerkes Pri-\r\nmate Laboratory in the mid-1950s, Nissen deplored behaviorists’ use of food depri-\r\nvation as a motivator to get chimps to do experimental work.94\r\nPrimatologists Harry Harlow and Donald Meyer questioned whether food depriva-\r\ntion had any impact on learning, and whether hunger should be called a “drive” at all.\r\nMonkeys in the Wisconsin Primate Laboratory, deprived of food for zero, two, seven,\r\nor twenty-three hours, showed no difference in rates of error or activity on a discrim-\r\nination learning test.95 In a blistering commentary, Harlow reprised some of Yerkes\r\nand others’ early critiques of the hunger apparatus: “The kinds of learning problems\r\nwhich can be efficiently measured in these apparatus represent a challenge only to the\r\ndecorticate animal. It is a constant source of bewilderment to me that the neobehav-\r\niorists . . . should choose apparatus which, in effect, experimentally decorticate their\r\nsubjects.”96 Though his educational film portrayed a direct correlation between hun-\r\nger and learning, Neal Miller advised readers of his own scientific publications to use\r\n“caution in drawing inferences about ‘drive’ from consummatory behavior in both\r\npsychological and psychiatric studies.”97\r\nYoung people in classrooms around 1948 must have encountered a doubling or en-\r\ntangling effect in this educational film. The film technology replicates its subject, the\r\nrat learning apparatus, on a material, sonic, and visual level. The authoritative bass\r\nvoice tells students what they are learning (the content of their lesson) and how they\r\nare learning, like the rats on the screen. “Now, what do you think the satiated rat has\r\nlearned to do?” With which rat were students meant to identify? The Very-Hungry\r\nRat, diligent and active in pursuit of its end? The Not-Hungry Rat, who at first ap-\r\npears stupid or lazy, and then is shocked into rapid learning? Did students experience\r\nthis film as punishment or reward?\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nCats, rats, students, and displaced Native Americans were entangled in the histories of\r\ntwentieth-century hunger. Close attention to experimental animals helps us imagine a\r\nhistory of hunger. Hunger experiments reproduced dynamics of eugenics, settler colo-\r\nnialism, and racial exclusion. The animals’ surroundings and gestures leave us hints as\r\nto the nature of those dynamics. This was the situation: hard work for meager returns,92 John F.

Thorndike’s cat experiments reflect and condense a\r\ndeep social and political history. These experiments help us to think historically about\r\nfood deprivation, its material and political effects. A history of animal models helps us\r\nto sense hunger as what Michelle Murphy calls a “material-semiotic-affective infra-\r\nstructural presence.”16\r\nA SIMPLE CASE OF LEARNING\r\nIn 1897, Edward Thorndike put a young cat in an uncomfortable situation:16 M\r\n17 T\r\n18 G\r\nConnIf we take a box twenty by fifteen by twelve inches, replace its cover and the front side by\r\nbars an inch apart, and make in this front side a door arranged so as to fall open when a\r\nwooden button inside is turned from a vertical to a horizontal position, we shall have\r\nmeans to observe [a] simple case of learning. A kitten, three to six months old, if put\r\nin this box when hungry, a bit of fish being left outside, reacts as follows: it tries to\r\nsqueeze through the bars, and bites at its confining walls. Some one of all these promis-\r\ncuous clawings, squeezings, and bitings turns round the wooden button, and the kitten\r\ngains freedom and food. By repeating the experience again and again, the animal grad-\r\nually comes to omit all the useless clawing, etc., and to manifest only the particular im-\r\npulse (e.g., to claw hard at the top of the button with the paw, or to push against one side\r\nof it with the nose) which has resulted successfully. It turns the button round without de-\r\nlay whenever put in the box. It has formed an association between the situation, “confine-\r\nment in a box of a certain appearance,” and the impulse to the act of clawing at a certain\r\npoint of that box in a certain definite way.17Many questions arise from this experimental description. What elements define this\r\nsetup as a model of learning? How is it a “simple case”? Why kittens, and why were\r\nthey hungry? What does it mean to think of this setup, described as “confinement in a\r\nbox of a certain appearance,” as a “situation”?\r\nOne set of clues can be found in the history of Thorndike’s menagerie and his ac-\r\nademic trajectory. Thorndike’s model system for learning, which was hungry kittens\r\nin a box, became a paradigm for American educational practice. Learning, Thorndike\r\ntold his readers, was governed by situations, not by culture or personality. Certain\r\nsituations could become technologies for producing effects in the mind. Thorndike’s\r\nexperiments also shaped the new discipline of comparative psychology. Hunger be-\r\ncame a tool for producing psychological knowledge, and a model for how to stimu-\r\nlate learning.\r\nHaving carried out animal experiments for a year in William James’s basement,\r\nThorndike moved to complete his doctorate at Columbia University, which was more\r\naccommodating with a graduate stipend and on-campus laboratory space. He wrote to\r\nhis future wife, Bess, that he was impatient to install his “menagerie” at Columbia; he\r\nwas, he wrote, “hungry for work.”18 He was ambitious and eager to challenge prevail-\r\ning assumptions about animal intuition and intellect. As the child of a New England\r\ntraveling minister, he was raised in a culture of self-control and diligence; his prodi-\r\ngious publication record testifies to his professional discipline.

All at once, the box opened, and the cat leaped out toward\r\nthe fish smell. The man offered her a tiny morsel; this was her “reward.” The man picked\r\nthe cat up and returned her to the box. Still driven by utter hunger, the cat began again\r\nto move about until the box door gave way, again and again, as she gained very small\r\npieces of fish, until the time when she no longer returned to the box. At the end of the\r\nday, at last, the cats could eat “abundant food to maintain health, growth and spirits, but\r\ncommonly some what less than they would of their own accord have taken.”1\r\nDogs came after the cats, though the dogs howled loudly at night when the man left\r\nthem hungry, and their cries awoke William James and his family sleeping upstairs.\r\nThe dogs, like the cats, lived experimentally in James’s basement, which James had\r\nlent to his postgraduate student as no suitable space could be found at Harvard Uni-\r\nversity. Because of their howls, the dogs could not live in “utter hunger.” They exer-\r\ncised in the wooden boxes in the morning, when they had not yet eaten, and they\r\n“made great effort for a bit of meat,” if somewhat irregularly.2\r\nEdward L. Thorndike’s experiments at the turn of the twentieth century set up an-\r\nimal hunger as a model system for understanding human motivation and learning.\r\nHungry animals participated in over a hundred years’ worth of experiments designed\r\nto characterize human emotions and behavior. Nonhuman hunger was central to the\r\nformation of both comparative psychology and neuroscience. Hunger, along with elec-\r\ntric shocks, became standard tools for producing psychological effects, such as moti-\r\nvation, excitement, fear, learning. Hunger (mostly mouse hunger) remains an impor-\r\ntant model system today in the fields of behavioral genetics and neurochemistry.\r\nHunger became an epistemic tool, designed to produce behaviors and emotions.\r\nScientists deprived kittens, monkeys, chicks, turtles, children, and soldiers of food\r\nfor four, eight, twenty-four, or forty-eight hours to observe the variable effects. Hun-\r\nger became a standard tool, in part because its intensity could be controlled on an ob-\r\njectively measured scale, as could shocks of electrical voltage or hours of depriva-\r\ntion. I want to think through the meaning and context of this choice. What is the\r\nnature of hunger as an epistemic tool and as a model system? Why did hunger appeal\r\nto Thorndike and his colleagues at the turn of the twentieth century as a reasonable and\r\nproductive relation with their animal subjects? What preexisting relations made hunger\r\nan obvious choice? What relations, in the end, did hunger experiments produce?\r\nWhy hunger? What brought Thorndike to introduce hunger to these formative ex-\r\nperiments in comparative psychology and why does hunger remain so central to this\r\nfield? I am interested in how hunger, as a model system, helped to establish a field of\r\nbehavioral-physiological-neuroscientific knowledge. I am evenmore interested in what\r\nthe traces of these model systems, and the animals within them, can tell us about the\r\nglobal history of hunger.\r\nIn this article, I think through hunger as a situation. When Thorndike built wooden\r\n“problem boxes” in William James’s basement and put food-deprived cats in them,\r\nhe created a new kind of situation (fig. 1). Thorndike set out to build an objective,\r\nexperimental model for animal learning. In his view, animals (and people) had no\r\ninnate personality or intelligence. Mental life was formed entirely by responding to1 Edward L.

Ferrier was involved in attempts in\r\nthe 1870s to localize sensations and muscle movements in specific brain areas. He\r\nablated or applied electrical stimulation to different areas of monkey and dog brains\r\nto observe the results.43 Ferrier acknowledged an intellectual debt to Herbert Spen-\r\ncer’s pleasure-pain theory of learning.44 Actions that produce pleasure, he wrote,\r\n“tend to continuance and repetition,” whereas actions associated with hurt and pain\r\n“are checked and avoided.”45\r\nFerrier sought to redirect animals’ voluntary movements, to produce “learning,” by\r\nthe application of pleasure and pain. The experimental tools he described in his book\r\nThe Functions of the Brain (1880) involved burning animals’ skin and submitting\r\nthem to hunger. Ferrier proposed that even a hungry animal can be taught by painful\r\nexperience to avoid food. “A hungry dog,” he wrote, “is impelled by the sight of food\r\nto seize and eat.” But this gratification can be “neutralized and counteracted” by an\r\neven stronger sensation of pain. Ferrier recounted the story of a hungry dog that was\r\nstruck with a strong whip each time it came near to food. Soon enough it ceased to\r\neat. Thereby “the dog is said to have learnt to curb its appetite.”46\r\nFor Ferrier, relief of hunger stood on the “pleasurable” end of the sensory spectrum.\r\nIn his anecdote about the dog learning to curb its appetite, its pleasure in food was\r\ncurbed by painful interventions. By contrast, he burned and whipped his animals to pro-\r\nduce sensations of pain. Thorndike did not employ tools for inflicting pain on his kit-\r\ntens, dogs, and chicks. However, he adopted Ferrier’s equivalence of pain-punishment-\r\navoidance and pleasure-reward-repetition. He deprived his experimental subjects and\r\nthen gave them food; this, for Thorndike, stood in for pleasure.\r\nThorndike wholly adopted Spencer and Ferrier’s psychological utilitarianism.

Thorn-\r\ndike was the man who did it. “Thorndike succeeded in founding utilitarian psychology\r\nanew . . . reinvented as pure, value-free laboratory science, with no connections to pol-\r\nitics and history.”47 I am grateful to Gere for so perceptively drawing a path straight\r\nfrom Bentham to behaviorism, with Thorndike as its conveyor.

This, too, explains why hunger was\r\npart of his model for mental life. Ideologies of hunger, learning, and capitalism formed\r\nan implicit part of Thorndike’s experimental situation.\r\nA century of utilitarian philosophers held up hunger as a tool for learning; specif-\r\nically, this was a tool for impressing laborious and thrifty behaviors upon spendthrift\r\nand shiftless people. Hunger was the philosopher’s whip. The Reverend Joseph Town-\r\nsend, a fellow traveler of Jeremy Bentham’s, thought that charity aid injured the poor\r\nby preventing them from learning the lessons of hunger: “Hunger will tame the fiercest\r\nanimals, it will teach decency and civility, obedience and subjection, to the most brut-\r\nish, the most obstinate and the most perverse.”48 Robert Thomas Malthus famously\r\nargued that hunger and famine should teach the poor to exercise moral restraint, to\r\npostpone marriage until they had the means to feed a family.49\r\nBeside moral decency and diligence, hunger stimulated investment in private prop-\r\nerty. A “love of property,”Herbert Spencer proposed, “evolved” from hunger. If a man\r\nwere struck with hunger while wandering about, and if he were to remember where\r\nhe had last encountered some uneaten foodstuffs, Spencer imagined, he would return\r\nto that very place to satisfy himself. His feelings would attach themselves to memo-\r\nries of particular things (foods) and places, which eventually he would want to own\r\nfor himself. This same pattern recurs over and over, and possessiveness is born. “A\r\nsubsequently-recurring hunger . . . will establish an organized connection between the\r\nremembrance of such remaining food and the various states of consciousness pro-\r\nduced by a return to it. Thus will be constituted an anticipation of a return to it—a\r\ntendency to perform all such actions accompanying a return to it as are not negatived\r\nby satiety—a tendency, therefore, to take possession of it.”50 Once the desire to pos-\r\nsess goods evolves, its reach spreads to shelter, clothing, tools, and, finally, to all va-\r\nrieties of goods. Satisfaction of hunger grows into all the many satisfactions of a civ-\r\nilized capitalist lifestyle. “It results that the excitement of possession will grow into\r\none of a new kind, uniting into a large but vague aggregate the various excitements to\r\nwhich it ministers.”51 Spencer offered a natural formula for private property, perhaps\r\neven more direct than John Locke’s famous untilled field.\r\nEchoing Spencer, Thorndike referred to acquisition and possession as “original\r\ntendencies concernedwith food getting.”He derived possessiveness from young child-\r\nren’s tendency to grasp objects and put them in their mouths. Hunting and food gath-\r\nering explain the “original tendency” to “pounce,” “grab,” and “seize” at things.52 The\r\ndesire for property makes a subtle appearance as a logical, evolutionary outgrowth of\r\nhunger.\r\nBuilt into the cats’ situation, then, was the assumption that hunger drove animals\r\nand people to work. Human industry, the desire to work and to achieve, came from\r\nthe promise of satisfaction. Hunger’s discomfort was a stimulus to civilization. But\r\nThorndike’s experimental setup belies this claim.48 Cited in ibid., 101.\r\n49 Thomas Robert Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798; repr., Cambridge: Cam-\r\nbridge Univ.

In these same years another pioneer \r\nin animal research, Robert Mearns Yerkes, also worked to extend the \r\nrange of possible subjects; although usually known as a primatologist, \r\nhe conducted trial-and-error studies on reptiles, amphibians, crabs, \r\nsquirrels, and \"dancing mice\" (hereditary oddities that displayed con­\r\nstant restless movements).

They were a shorthand way of \r\nasking, \"Why does the self behave as it does?\" 13 An anin1al within a \r\nmaze was faced with choices, confusions, blind alleys, and difficulties. \r\nFinding himself hungry ( that is, \"motivated\") and in a place where \r\ndangers lay all around (electric shock, cold, poison, thirst), the rat en­\r\ncountered the twists and turns of what Milton in Paradise Lost called \r\n\"mazy error\" and what behaviorists called \"choice-points.\" The n1aze \r\nhad long stood for the struggle to find one's way when the truth was \r\nelusive and the way fraught with n1onsters and despair: Theseus had \r\nkilled the Minotaur in the labyrinth; the Christian Wayfarer of Pil­\r\ngri,n's Progress sought God in one; and Nietzsche begged to be lost \r\n1n one. \r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:33:51.003Z","citation":"","pageIndex":50,"uniqueId":"LemWorld06","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[LemWorld06]] LemovR - 2006 - World as Laboratory - Experiments with Mice, Mazes, and Men.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[LemWorld06]] LemovR - 2006 - World as Laboratory - Experiments with Mice, Mazes, and Men.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:33:51.015Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:33:51.003Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"12f7e480-0789-4213-9416-bdadbe77dcc9","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-03T02:44:03.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:33:51.733Z","text":"Clark Leonard Hull galvanized a young group\r\nof experimentalists at Yale with his goal of \r\ncreating a unified theory of human behavior. \r\nEventually he developed eighteen theorems in\r\nhis 1943 Pri11ciplcs of H1111w11 Bclznvior, \r\nand left behind seventy-three \"Idea Books\" \r\nfull of designs for thinking automata, \r\nor \"psychic machines.\" (Courtesy Yale University \r\nManuscripts and Archives) \r\n","title":"psychic machines!!!

As I shall note\r\nbelow, I disagree with Shugg’s work in several respects. In particular,\r\nShugg was not concerned to trace the origins of scientific attitudes toward\r\nanimals in the more general philosophical discussions of the period on\r\nthe moral status of animals; he cited only the arguments of Descartes\r\nmentioned above.8 In his recent book, Man and the Natural World, Keith\r\nThomas stated that attitudes toward animals began to change during the\r\nseventeenth century from the older utilitarian view of animals as the\r\nservants of man to a recognition that they, too, felt pain and even emotion,\r\nemotion. The treatment of animals therefore became a moral question.9\r\nIn this essay I wish to ask if, within a limited context, we can substantiate\r\nthis claim with regard to vivisection.\r\n5 Rene Descartes, Oeuvres, ed.

To him\r\nhuman existence was\r\nbased on the play of blind forces and only a matter of chance. . . .

Economic, social, and political conditions or ignorance\r\nand superstition may warp and inhibit the inherited instincts and thus\r\ncreate a civilization with a faulty or low development of ethics. . . . Not\r\nonly is the mechanistic conception of life compatible with ethics: it seems\r\nthe only conception of life which can lead to an understanding of the\r\nsource of ethics.45\r\nIt may be difficult to believe that a man who maintained that\r\nhumans were “machine-like” and that only the mechanistic con-\r\nception could lead to an understanding of ethics could have a\r\ngenuine regard for suffering humanity.

Later, work with agricultural\r\nscientists such as Sachs enabled Loeb to\r\nlook at physiology with a more activist,\r\ninterventionist, controlling attitude than\r\ndid most ofthe other physiologists at that\r\ntime. Loeb was also fortunate to have the\r\nfacilities ofthe Naples Zoological Station\r\navailable to him, so that he was able to\r\nperform extensive research on lower an-\r\nimals. Finally, Loeb was greatly attracted\r\nto the ideas of such theorists as Mach,\r\nwho advocated the unification of science\r\nand technology. Loeb engaged in a long\r\ncorrespondence with Mach.\r\nSome of Loeb's research could be eas-\r\nily described as coming under the prov-\r\nince ofwhat we now call psychology. For\r\nexample, he conducted experiments on\r\npsychophysics, optical illusions, and\r\ntropisms. While at Bryn Mawr, he re-\r\nquested a laboratory for teaching human\r\nand comparative psychology. In all of\r\nLoeb's psychological research, he ad-\r\nhered to models that emphasized data\r\nrather than psychological theory.\r\nFor behaviorists, probably the greatest\r\nsignificance ofLoeb's work was his influ-\r\nence on Watson and Skinner. There were\r\nmany points ofcontact between Loeb and\r\nthese two, most famous, behaviorists. As\r\nWatson relates in his autobiography\r\n(1936), while in graduate school at the\r\nUniversity ofChicago between 1900 and\r\n1903, he took a course with Loeb. Loeb\r\nwanted Watson to do his Ph.D. thesis\r\nwith him, but Donaldson and Angell felt\r\nthat Loeb was not a very safe choice, and\r\nultimately Watson worked with them.\r\nHowever, Watson felt that he owed an\r\nunrepayable debt to Loeb. Later, when\r\nWatson had joined Johns Hopkins Uni-\r\nversity, he corresponded and worked with\r\nYerkes, who was also strongly influenced\r\nby Loeb's work. In Skinner's case, the\r\nonly two science books that Skinner read\r\nas an undergraduate were two books by\r\nLoeb. Between college and graduate\r\nschool, Skinner read Watson's Behavior-\r\nism and, based on that book, decided to\r\nbecome a behaviorist. In graduate school,\r\nSkinner was trained by another strong\r\nadvocate ofLoeb's work, Crozier. A quote\r\nfrom Skinner on thejacket ofPauly's book\r\ndescribes the book as \"the fascinating\r\nstory of a too-often neglected figure in\r\nthe history of the biological and behav-\r\nioral sciences.\"\r\nThe degree of similarity between Pau-\r\nly's description of Loeb's engineering bi-\r\nology and Watson's and Skinner's be-\r\nhaviorism is astounding. For example,\r\nboth research areas have emphasized\r\ncontrol of the phenomena under study,\r\nhave seen no division between science\r\nand technology, and have led to the de-\r\nvelopment of useful technologies (in bi-\r\nology, innovations such as the birth con-\r\ntrol pill; in behaviorism, innovations such\r\nas teaching machines). Scientists in both\r\nareas have felt it important to study the\r\norganism as a whole and have been op-\r\nposed to dualism. Both have felt it im-\r\nportant to construct models that focus on\r\ndata, as opposed to theories, as much as\r\npossible, and both have been opposed to\r\npurely psychological concepts such as will.\r\nFinally, both have been advocates of a\r\npositivistic approach to science. Pauly\r\ngoes so far as to describe Watson's 1913\r\nbehaviorist manifesto as setting out \"the\r\nLoebian engineering standpoint in psy-\r\nchology\" (p. 174).\r\nThe similarities between engineering\r\nbiology and behaviorism also extend to\r\nthe personalities and styles of their\r\nfounders. Loeb, Watson, and Skinner\r\nhave all been polemical, action-oriented,\r\npragmatic scientists. None have been in-\r\nterested in unresolvable, philosophical\r\nquestions or in working out the minute\r\ndetails of a problem. All have been very\r\ncreative men who have continually sought\r\nout new and interesting questions and\r\nhave shown little caution in expressing\r\ntheir opinions in print. One major dif-\r\nference between these men, however, a\r\ndifference not pointed out by Pauly, is\r\nthat while Loeb's goal was to develop\r\nbiology so as to satisfy all sorts of useful\r\ngoals, he was very careful in drawing any\r\nbut the most limited implications from\r\nhis own work. This would probably not\r\nbe said about Watson and Skinner.

This comment may be interpreted as indicative of a rather total attitude \r\nto the matter of “Americanism” which prevailed in the United States at that time, \r\nto  which we have already alluded. Within American culture there is a deep con- \r\nflict between two visions of what man is in his natural state. On the one hand, there \r\nis the vision that the “natural man” embodies positive character traits, that the \r\n‘‘natural man” is the good man. In  this vision, man becomes corrupt due to the \r\nprocess of civilization. T o  a large degree this vision was associated-with Jacksonian- \r\nism and the ‘kise of the common man” in the first half of the 19th century. In  litera- \r\nture it is represented by Janies Feriimore Cooper and his way of celebrating what is \r\nessentially Rousscau’s “noble savage,” Walt Whitnian in Leaves of Grass and W. H. \r\nHudson in Green Mansions. On the other hand, there is the vision of man as being \r\nnaturally depraved, to be altered by the firm hand of civilized education, a vision \r\nmost closely associated with Calvinistic Protestantism. There are few spheres of \r\nsocial thought within American culture in which this issue is not pr,esent in some \r\nform or other. Although the linkage is not a necessary one, as many contra-examples \r\ncan indicate, nonetheless there has historically been a rather close connection be- \r\n‘Cf., e.g., Handlin’s description of the shock to immigrants of the American style of agriculture \r\n(27, pp. 82 ff.). \r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:33:06.526Z","citation":"","pageIndex":12,"uniqueId":"BakBehaviorism66","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[BakBehaviorism66]] BakanD - 1966 - Behaviorism and American urbanization.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[BakBehaviorism66]] BakanD - 1966 - Behaviorism and American urbanization.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:33:06.576Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:33:06.526Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"6d3898e4-f339-40b8-a38d-48eed4188723","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-10T05:25:58.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:17.667Z","text":"If, therefore, these performances of the puppies, and a thousand\r\nsuch actions of the higher animals, are excluded from the class of\r\ninstincts by their want of uniformity and by their more or less\r\nadequate adaptation to meet special and unusual circumstances, how\r\nare we to place them ?

We passed through and watched\r\nthe puppies. Both blundered against the uprights, which caught\r\nthe ends of the canes. There was a little scrimmaging and some\r\nfurther ineffectual struggles, and then both dropped the sticks and\r\ncame through. Their master sent them back to “ fetch.” The first\r\nto arrive at the gap just put his head through, seized a cane by the\r\nend and dragged it after him. The other ran through the gap,\r\npicked up the cane as usual by the middle, and blundered as before.\r\nAgain he dropped it and came through. I then went back and\r\nplaced the stick so that he could put his head through and seize the\r\nend as the other had done. But again he went through bodily,\r\npicked up the cane as before, and blundered. Then his master\r\ntaught him how to do it. On our return an hour or so afterwards\r\nI held the cleverer pup, so that it might be seen how far the other\r\nhad learnt his lesson. He blundered, however, as before. Then we\r\ncalled him off, and allowed the other pup to have his turn. He,\r\ntoo, blundered for a little, and then came back to us. We passed\r\nthrough the gap and called him after us. Again he blundered ; but\r\nthen, dropping the cane, came through, and, turning, seized the\r\ncane by the middle, and tried to pull it after him. Of course it\r\ncaught, and fell out of his mouth. He then seized it nearer the\r\nend. Even so it caught ; but, by turning his head about, after some\r\nlittle scrambling, he eventually pulled it through.\r\nThese pups, then, did not act alike ; both had to learn by experience\r\nhow to meet new circumstances. Their actions were certainly not\r\ninstinctive, if uniformity of performance is a characteristic of instinct.\r\nWhether the pups were conscious of certain means as subservient to\r\nthe end in view, is a point on which there is likely to be difference of\r\nopinion. It is remarkable, however, that the more intelligent pup when\r\nsent back in the first instance seized the cane at once by the end and\r\ndragged it through ; and if the observations had been carried no\r\nfurther, one might have supposed that he clearly perceived the best\r\nmeans to effect the desired result. But the second time he did not\r\nseize the end of the stick, and this may well lead one to suppose that\r\nit was rather good fortune than clear perception which made him\r\nsuccessful before.\r\nIf, therefore, these performances of the puppies, and a thousand\r\nsuch actions of the higher animals, are excluded from the class of\r\ninstincts by their want of uniformity and by their more or less\r\nadequate adaptation to meet special and unusual circumstances, how\r\nare we to place them ? It is clear that if we adopt the broad divi¬\r\nsion of all activities into instinctive on the one hand and rational\r\non the other hand, we must term them rational.

Do we not again and again see our dogs racing round after\r\neach other, and cutting off corners as they do so ? Is there not here\r\na sufficient basis in experience for a direct association between what\r\nwe call a short cut and more rapid transit ? The dog had admittedly\r\nrun the rabbit into that particular drain several times. May not\r\nthis experience have led to the association of the rabbit and the\r\ndrain ? And the drain being thus suggested, may not the dog have\r\nat once run there ? In a word, may not the dog’s conduct be\r\nexplained as the outcome of direct experience and association, and\r\nnot as the result of the perception of a relation, that between the\r\nchord and the arc of a circle, over which Hodge, the farmer’s lad,\r\nfinds no little difficulty ?

Mr. Romanes records an\r\ninteresting observation, of which one of his own dogs was the subject.\r\nThis dog was cowed by the sound of apples being shot on to the floor\r\nof a loft above the stable ; but when Mr. Romanes took the dog up\r\ninto the loft, and let him see what was going on, he ceased to be\r\ndisquieted by the noise. In his index, Mr. Romanes enters this\r\nunder the heading, “Appreciation of cause by the dog.” Now here,\r\nagain, two interpretations are possible. If the dog really perceived\r\nthe relation of causation as such, he had rational grounds for\r\nceasing to be disquieted; but if it was merely a matter of association\r\nof impressions and ideas, his satisfaction was simply intelligence.\r\nLet me illustrate what I mean by a somewhat parallel case. Some\r\nyears ago my cat was asleep on a chair, and my little boy was\r\nblowing a toy horn. The cat, without moving, mewed uneasily.\r\nI told my boy to go on blowing. The cat grew more uneasy, got up,\r\nstretched herself, and turned towards the source of discomfort. She\r\nstood looking at my boy for a minute as he blew ; then, curling her¬\r\nself up, she went to sleep again, and no amount of blowing disturbed\r\nher further. With regard to my cat’s procedure, and Mr. Romanes’\r\ndog, I suggest the following explanation. For animals, I take it,\r\nCopyright © Contemporary Review Company Ltd.

He feels this quite clearly ; it is the result of a good deal of\r\nexperience gained in that kitchen and elsewhere ; but it has never\r\noccurred to him, nor, as I think probable, to any of his kind, to\r\nunhitch his consciousness from the interesting bone, and fix it upon\r\nits relation to him or to anything else in space.\r\nLet us next suppose that our kindly cook gradually lowers the\r\nbone until it is within reach of the dog’s jaws. He is, I need hardly\r\nsay, a well-bred beast, and does not attempt to snap ; but when the\r\nbone is well within reach, he quite gently takes it from the cook’s\r\nfingers, and goes out with it into the yard. He here employs certain\r\ndefinite means to reach certain definite ends ; but he has probably\r\nno notion of the relation of means to ends as such ; his consciousness\r\nis quite otherwise occupied. When I stretch out my hand to dip\r\nthe pen into the ink I have no thought of means and ends. I feel\r\nsure that the old gentleman I met yesterday at dinner, who filled\r\nhis glass to the brim with port, and after holding it to the light\r\nlifted it to his lips without spilling a drop on his ample shirt-front,\r\ndid not trouble his head about ends and means. I am not hinting\r\nthat he was incapable of doing so ; I merely record my belief that\r\nhe did not do so. And when the dog rises on his hind legs and\r\ngently takes the bone from the cook’s hands, he pays, I imagine, no\r\nmore attention to the means employed to attain his end than the\r\ncook does in the movement of her arm and hand in giving it to him.\r\nThe movements of both are conscious actions ; in each case they\r\ninvolve much accurate muscular co-ordination, but the motor feelings,\r\nthough undoubtedly marginal, probably in neither case come to the\r\nfocus of consciousness. Even if they do, the true relationship\r\nbetween these means and the end in view is not perceived as a\r\ndistinct impression or idea.\r\nThe difference, then, between intelligent actions and their rational\r\ninterpretation lies in the fact that for intelligence it is sufficient that\r\nwhat we call the relationships of natural objects should be felt on the\r\nmargin of consciousness, inalienably associated with the objects\r\nthemselves, while for reason it is necessary that relationships should\r\nbe so far dissociated from the objects as to occupy the focus of con¬\r\nsciousness. Such being the distinction, let us now consider a few\r\ncases of animal intelligence of progressive complexity in the light\r\nthereof.\r\nWe may begin with a very simple case. On the evening of their\r\nfourth day of active life I placed before my little chicks two objects\r\nnew to their experience, a small worm and a yellow and black cater¬\r\npillar —that of the cinnabar moth, so common, in the summer, on\r\nragwort. The birds looked a little timidly and suspiciously at both\r\nof them. So far as I could judge, they were not more suspicious of\r\nCopyright © Contemporary Review Company Ltd.

The instincts\r\nwere very nearly, but not quite, perfect.\r\nSo much in illustration of the distinction between instinct and\r\nintelligence. I shall have a harder task in drawing the distinction\r\nbetween intelligence and reason ; not because, as I believe, the dis¬\r\ntinction is a less real and valid one, but because it is more subtle,\r\nand involves a somewhat closer analysis of the activities of the\r\nmind.\r\nLet us endeavour to build up, stage by stage, from the foundations\r\nwe have already laid. Animals and men come into the world\r\nendowed with an innate capacity for active response to certain\r\nstimuli. This is part of their organic inheritance. The response\r\nmay be from the first an accurate and adequate response : in such\r\ncases we term it instinctive. But more frequently the responses\r\nhave a variable amount of inaccuracy and inadequacy ; in such cases\r\nthe animal, as a matter of observed fact, has a power of selective\r\ncontrol over the responses ; and this power of selective control in\r\nthe activities which are essential to daily life, is the first stage of\r\nintelligence. Now why do I say intelligence and not reason ? Well,\r\nlet us go back to Sydney Smith’s description of the reasoned act :\r\n“ If I desire to do a certain thing,” he says, “ adopt certain means\r\nto effect it, and have a clear and precise notion that those means are\r\nsubservient to that end, then I act from reason.” But have we any\r\nground for supposing that a chick, a few hours old, has “a clear and\r\nprecise notion that those means are subservient to that end?” Is\r\nit probable that the baby who is learning to put a crust into his\r\nmouth and not into his eye has any precise notions of the relation of\r\nmeans to ends ? If not, then here we have a class of activities, and\r\na very important class, those, namely, which are essential to daily\r\nlife, which are perfected by means of a faculty which is not reason,\r\nand which I would term intelligence. To paraphrase Sydney Smith\r\nI would say, “ If I adopt certain means to effect a given end, but\r\nhave no cleax1 and precise notion of the relation of means to end,\r\nthen I act not from reason but from intelligence.” And to modify\r\na well-known statement of Mr. Romanes’, I would say that, “ unlike\r\nreason, intelligence implies no conscious knowledge of the relation\r\nbetween the means employed and the ends attained, though it may\r\nbe exercised in selective adaptation to circumstances novel alike to\r\nthe experience of the individual and to that of the species.”\r\nHow far then does this intelligent adaptation to circumstances, as\r\nopposed to the truly rational perception of the relation of means to\r\nends—how far, in a word, does intelligence, as distinguished from\r\nreason, extend? Let us, in endeavouring to answer this question,\r\ncontinue to build upwards from the basis of the innate capacity for\r\nresponse. It is clear that my little chicks could not peck with more\r\nVOL.

I do not think he had been\r\nstung, if so he quickly got over any ill effects and was happy and\r\neager about other things in a few minutes ; more probably he had\r\ntasted the poison. In any case he no longer took any interest in\r\nthat bee. Some hours later on the same day (his fifth) I placed\r\nbeneath a glass tumbler in my yard a blue-bottle and a small\r\nhumble-bee, from both of which a portion of the wings had been (of\r\ncourse painlessly) removed. Blackie and one other peeked at both,\r\nseen through the glass. I then let the bee escape ; Blackie snapped\r\nit up, ran off with it, and soon swallowed it. Another small humble-\r\nbee he went for at once, disabled it by dashing it against the ground\r\nwith his bill, and swallowed it. Both of these humble-bees had\r\nstings. I was rather surprised at the results of these experiments,\r\nbut give them as they are recorded in my notes taken down at the\r\ntime.\r\nNow, how shall we describe instinct ? I go back to my little\r\nchick in its early efforts at peeking. Here we have a motor response\r\nto a certain stimulus. And there can be very little question that\r\nthe motor response is, as we are apt to say, purely mechanical, or as\r\nwe should more correctly say, purely organic. It is of the nature\r\nof a reflex act, like our own winking, or the closure of the hand of a\r\nsleeping child on your finger placed within its palm. But it is a\r\nreflex act, the performance of which is accompanied by conscious¬\r\nness, if we use the word consciousness in its broadest sense to describe\r\nany sort of feeling, dim or clear, vague or distinct. And the role of\r\nconsciousness on the matter of pecking is to select the adequate\r\nresponses and to steady the muscular mechanism to its work. Let\r\nus describe the organic motor reflexes as due to innate capacity for\r\nmotor response. Then in the animal kingdom we find that the\r\nresponses which are the outcome of this innate capacity are variable\r\nin their adequacy. My chicks, for example, at first made bad shots\r\nas well as occasional good shots. Now the greater the variability\r\nand the greater the initial percentage of inadequacy, the more\r\nnecessity is there for acquisition of skill by the individual. On the\r\nother hand, the less the variability and the smaller the initial per¬\r\ncentage of inadequate response, the less the necessity for any\r\nindividual acquisition of skill.\r\nAnd now we can give a good working definition of instinct in its\r\nobjective aspect. Instinctive activities, in their theoretical perfec¬\r\ntion, are those in which there is no variability, in which the\r\npercentage of inadequacy is nil, and in which, therefore, there is no\r\nnecessity for any intelligent acquisition of skill. If my chicks had\r\npecked perfectly from the first they would have had this instinct\r\nin perfection.

I venture to think, however, that there is between\r\nthe uniform performance of instinct, on the one hand, and the con¬\r\nscious knowledge of reason on the other, a vast field of animal and\r\nhuman activity which I would distinguish from both by the appli¬\r\ncation of the term “ intelligence.” I am well aware that the term\r\n“ intelligence ” is by the usage I advocate somewhat narrowed down.\r\nI am well aware that Mr. Romanes and others use the word “intelli¬\r\ngence ” as synonymous with “ reason ” ; but there is no one conve¬\r\nnient word that can take its place. And since Mr. Romanes has\r\ncollected a most interesting body of facts and observations in a\r\nvolume under the title Animal Intelligence, it has seemed to me that\r\nthe word “ intelligence,” is, in this field of inquiry, that best fitted\r\nto express the wide region of mental activity which lies between\r\ninstinct and reason. In place, then, of the twofold division into\r\ninstinct and reason, I advocate a threefold division into instinct,\r\nintelligence, and reason ; and it is my present purpose to endeavour\r\nto define and illustrate the limits of the middle term of these three,\r\nnamely intelligence. This, be it noted, is a separate question from\r\nthat which inquires whether animals have the faculty of reason. I\r\nshall incidentally express an opinion on that question ; but it is, I\r\nrepeat, a matter which is distinct from the immediate subject of this\r\narticle.\r\nIt will be well, first, to pay some attention to the difference letween\r\nintelligence and instinct, and since concrete examples are more\r\ninteresting than abstract definitions, I will describe some of the\r\nexperiments and observations I have lately made on young chicks.\r\nThe eggs from which in due course they emerged were taken\r\nfrom the hen two or three days before the time of hatching was\r\nfulfilled, and were placed in an incubator. The little birds, which\r\nwere of a good crossed breed with strains of Plymouth rock, Dork¬\r\ning, and game, had therefore no maternal help in gaining some\r\nexperience of the world. I first directed my attention to their\r\npowers of seizing and swallowing. Selecting one about eighteen\r\nhours old for definite experiment, I placed before him three small\r\npieces of white of egg, moving them about a little in front of him\r\nwith a long pin to draw his attention to them. He soon pecked at\r\none of these and seized it at the fifth attempt, swallowing it a little\r\nawkwardly. The next he struck at the second attempt, but not\r\nfairly, so that it was thrust aside. Transferring his attention there¬\r\nfore to the third piece he seized it and swallowed it at the third attempt.\r\nAn hour later I tried him again with egg and crumb of bread.\r\nHe generally struck the morsel at the second or third peck, though\r\nhe sometimes failed to seize it. Once he struck and seized at the\r\nfirst attempt. Later in the day I caused a small Hy to walk across\r\nmy experimental poultry yard, in front of the chicks ; most of them\r\nCopyright © Contemporary Review Company Ltd.

As\r\nthe animal has, in my view, no power of judging actions in relation\r\nto a standard of right, no power of appraising objects in relation to\r\na standard of beauty, so also it has, I conceive, no power of gauging\r\nits perceptions and conceptions in relation to a standard of truth.\r\nFor truth is a matter of intellectual knowledge, and such knowledge\r\nthe brutes have not. It lies beyond the limits of animal intelli¬\r\ngence.\r\nI have now, so far as is possible without entering into technical\r\ndetails, illustrated the distinction between intelligence and reason.\r\nIntelligence is the faculty by which, through experience and associa¬\r\ntion, activities are adapted to, or, more strictly, moulded by, new\r\ncircumstances ; while reason is the faculty which has its inception\r\nin the true grasping of relationships as such. Intelligence is ever\r\non the watch for fortunate variations of activity and happy hits of\r\nmotor response ; it feels that they are suitable, though it knows not\r\nhow and why, and controls future activities in their direction. It\r\nproceeds by trial and error, and selects the successes from among the\r\nfailures. Reason explains the suitability ; it shows wherein lies the\r\nsuccess or the error, and adapts conduct through a clear perception\r\nof the relationships involved. Individual experience, association,\r\nand imitation are the main factors of intelligence ; explanation and\r\nintentional adaptation are the goal of reason.\r\nIncidentally I have expressed my opinion that, in the activities of\r\nthe higher animals, marvellously intelligent as they often are, there\r\nis no evidence of that true perception of relationships which is\r\nessential to reason. But this is merely an opinion, and not a settled\r\nconviction. I shall not be the least ashamed of myself if I change\r\nthis view before the close of the present year. And the distinction\r\nbetween intelligence and reason will remain precisely the same if\r\nanimals are proved to be rational beings the day after to-morrow.\r\nFor the distinction holds good between human intelligence and\r\nhuman reason, just as much as between animal intelligence and the\r\npossible reason of animals. It is no line of division which separates\r\nanimals from men; but a distinction between faculties, one of which,\r\nat least (and perhaps both, though this I doubt), is common to\r\nanimals and men.\r\nC.

No. 1 January, 1918\r\nT H E PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW\r\nDOCILITY AND PURPOSIVENESS\r\nBY RALPH BARTON PERRY\r\nHarvard Unii/irsity\r\nIn two earlier papers,1 I have discussed various concep-\r\ntions which have been proposed as definitions of purpose,\r\nsuch as systematic unity, tendency, and adaptation. None of\r\nthese appears to give any meaning to such phrases as 'in\r\norder to' or 'for the sake of,' which I have selected as the\r\nmost unmistakably and unqualifiedly teleological expressions\r\nin common use. Adaptation, or complementary adjustment\r\nmay, if one so desires, be regarded as purposive in a broad\r\nsense. But I have thought it important to show that such\r\nprocesses may be construed as complex cases of ordinary\r\nautomatism or mechanism. Complementary adjustment\r\nmeans a give and take between environment and organism,\r\nin which the environment makes the first move, and in which\r\nthe exchange of actions obeys a constant law. Given the\r\nlaw, and any state of the varying environment (stimulus),\r\nthe response of the organism can be predicted. The law\r\nitself is like any mechanical law, and is simply obeyed by the\r\nresponding organism. The response is complementary; but\r\nit means nothing to say that it occurs in order to be comple-\r\nmentary, or for the sake of the complementary outcome.\r\nIn the case of plastic or modifiable behavior, we meet\r\nwith a new and important principle. The organism acquires\r\nor learns complementary adjustments. The proverbial burnt\r\nchild, for example, acquires a response that is appropriate\r\nto the stimulus of fire. It is not that the child does so\r\n'Purpose as Systematic Unity, Monist, 1917, 27, 352-375; and Purpose as\r\nTendency and Adaptation, Phil.

I went to the Newton\r\nPublic Schools, which were then, and still are, considered to be unusually\r\ngood, and then went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where\r\nI obtained a B.S. in electrochemistry in 1911. I went to M.I.T. not because\r\nI wanted to be an engineer, but because I had been good in mathematics\r\nand science in high school and because of family pressure. After graduating\r\nfrom Technology I became more certain of my own wants and transferred\r\nto Harvard for graduate work in philosophy and psychology.\r\nMy family was, I suppose, what now would be called \"upper middle\" or\r\npossibly \"lower upper.\" My father was president of a manufacturing com-\r\npany and my maternal uncle president of a similar company. My brother,\r\nwho was five years older, and I were, first one and then the other, expected\r\nto go into our father's business. Hence, we both went to M.I.T.; my father\r\nhad been a member of the first graduating class and was a Trustee. My\r\nbrother, however, escaped by becoming a theoretical chemist and physicist\r\nand I, having read some William James during my senior year at Technology,\r\nfancied that I wanted to become a philosopher. Upon graduating from\r\nM.I.T., I went to the Harvard summer school and took an introductory\r\ncourse in philosophy with Perry and one in psychology with Yerkes — both\r\nthen young assistant professors in the combined department of philosophy\r\nand psychology. I decided then and there that I did not have brains enough\r\nto become a philosopher (that was still the day of great metaphysical sys-\r\ntems), but that psychology was nearer my capacities and interests. It of-\r\nfered, at that date, what seemed a nice compromise between philosophy and\r\nscience.\r\nThe fact that my brother and I both avoided family expectations and\r\nchose academic careers, instead of going into the factory, and the further\r\nfact that this led to no family quarrels and that we were even financially\r\nsupported during the process, probably tells a good deal about the nature\r\nof the family setup and of the general cultural milieu in which we lived.\r\n323\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:31.157Z","citation":"","pageIndex":0,"uniqueId":"TolEdward52b","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[TolEdward52b]] TolmanE - 1952 - Edward Chace Tolman.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[TolEdward52b]] TolmanE - 1952 - Edward Chace Tolman.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:31.178Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:31.157Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"378f54d3-29e1-41e8-ac68-9fbadbab46db","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-10T04:44:39.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:31.510Z","text":"family.

I have always been obsessed by\r\na need for a single comprehensive theory or scheme for the whole of psy-\r\nchology. And I have also always wanted to be something more than a mere\r\nlearning or rat psychologist. I have wanted a scheme which would cover\r\nnot only rat learning but also one which would be pertinent to the problems\r\nof human thought and of human motivation. In Purposive Behavior in Ani-\r\nmals and Men I was already tempted into pronunciamentos concerning\r\nprimary and secondary drives, demands, insight and ideation as well as\r\nconcerning learning per se. And under the impetus of a general human\r\nconcern for social events and of a need to discover how man is ever to\r\nachieve a stable, or even a merely satisfying, society I have a number of\r\ntimes been tempted into relatively ad hoc assertions concerning drives or\r\nneeds and concerning complex motivational dynamisms both in individuals\r\nand in society.1*\r\nAll of these pronouncements have been somewhat abortive because of\r\nlack of training on my part in the other social sciences and even in person-\r\nality psychology and in social psychology. Yet I do not wish to disown\r\nthem. The pronouncements may have been naive; but I do not think that\r\nany of them has been basically wrong or mischievous. They constituted\r\nmy first steps towards a more complete conceptual scheme — a scheme which\r\nwould allow me to handle not only simple learning but also problems such\r\nas the operation of innate or socially acquired secondary and tertiary needs,\r\nthe operation of the psychoanalytical and other dynamisms, and finally, the\r\nexplanation and prevention of individual and social maladjustments. I have\r\nbeen concerned throughout with man's basic needs, biological or social, and\r\nwith the question of how these needs become modified through social learn-\r\ning as a result of given cultures and given training procedures within a\r\nfamily. Why is it that individuals and cultures go astray? Why is it that a\r\nsocial system seems so seldom to allow for reasonable satisfactions in most\r\nof the individuals involved in it? Can we arrive at some naturalistic defini-\r\ntions of the good life or of different kinds of good life?

In an article published in 1918 he wrote: \r\n“If the kitten should be excited to effort by the mere ap¬ \r\npearance of a button in a vertical position; if these efforts \r\nshould continue until a way was hit upon to turn it horizon¬ \r\ntally; and if the random efforts should then be replaced by \r\na stable propensity to perform the successful act, then we could \r\nsay that the kitten was trying to turn the button. . . .” [i.e., \r\npurposing the turning of the button] “In order that an organism \r\nmay be said to act in a certain way because of [by virtue of \r\npurposing] a certain result, it is necessary that acts, proving \r\n22 E. L. Thorndike, Animal Intelligence (New York, The Macmillan Com¬ \r\npany, 1911), p. 35 f. \r\n23 Webster defines docility as (a) teachableness, docileness; (b) willingness \r\nto be taught or trained; submissiveness, tractableness. We use it throughout \r\nin the sense of “teachableness.” (See Glossary.) \r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:30:21.051Z","citation":"","pageIndex":35,"uniqueId":"TolPurposive32a","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[TolPurposive32a]] TolmanE - 1932 - Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[TolPurposive32a]] TolmanE - 1932 - Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:30:21.059Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:21.051Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"2c7fb247-e68c-4bf8-a36b-fb7b7c8ccd57","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-10T03:06:44.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:20.995Z","text":"And yet, there seems to be no other way out.

Trial and error learning is a \r\nmatter of field-organization. \r\n12. Learning Nonsense Syllables \r\nFinally, it may be desirable to point out how the above analysis \r\nof trial and error learning applies to such an affair as the memoriz¬ \r\ning of nonsense syllables by human beings. In a typical nonsense \r\nsyllable experiment, the learner is presented a series of nonsense \r\nsyllables by means of a revolving drum. The drum is hidden be¬ \r\nhind a screen with a slit on it—the slit just wide enough to allow \r\none syllable to appear at a time. The subject’s task is to memorize \r\nthese syllables so that upon the appearance of the first syllable of \r\nthe list he can recite the others in proper order without looking at \r\nthem. This is, of course, the classical procedure—the so-called \r\nErlernungsmethode—devised by Ebbinghaus and further investi¬ \r\ngated by Muller and Schumann.38 \r\nIt will, now, be our contention that in such a situation what \r\n38 Similarly, it may well be that some of the unusual and unexpected effects \r\nof punishment on learning may be due to its hindering or helping in the build¬ \r\ning up of the total field-relationship between the right and the wrong responses. \r\n(See, for example, R. Valentine, The effects of punishment for errors on the \r\nmaze learning of rats, /. Comp. Psychol., 1930, 10, 35-54, who found that \r\npunishment introduced after a maze was half learned and continued from then \r\nuntil learning was complete was less efficacious than punishment introduced \r\nonly after the maze was three-quarters learned. Punishment coming near the \r\nmiddle of learning disrupted in a way that punishment coming near the end \r\nof learning did not.) \r\n37 For this general doctrine that there is no true trial and error, but that \r\nall learning, even that in the supposedly trial and error situation, is a function \r\nof the organism’s capacity to respond to a whole field we owe a tremendous \r\namount to Koffka’s discussion in the Growth of the Mind.

It is, however, essential \r\nto distinguish carefully between showing an animal how a trick \r\nis done, and furnishing useful accessory stimuli (such as the \r\noccasional taps of the trainer's whip when he wants a per­\r\nforming horse to kneel), or affording suitable conditions the \r\nresults of which temporarily enter into the association com­\r\nplex. If the latter be eliminated the practice of trainers, \r\nI believe, bears out the general result of the experiments. \r\nDr. Thorndike never succeeded in getting an animal to \r\nchange its way of doing a thing for his.

The point was that the classes of animate motion which \r\nprovided most of the content for the category of behaviour already \r\nincorporated qualities such as goal-directedness, organization and \r\nadaptability that had been attributed to the influence of a separate \r\nprivate mind under the old scheme. With their adoption of 'behaviour' \r\ncomparative psychologists were on the way to shedding a conceptual \r\nframework that presented them with insoluble problems. \r\nOne way of resolving these problems without shedding the traditional \r\nframework was to adopt a thoroughgoing materialism and declare mind \r\nan 'epiphenomenon', a kind of emanation given off by material \r\nprocesses that lacks all causal influence.

But this failure had far-\r\nreaching consequences. Initially, it promoted an emphasis on the dis-\r\ntinction between conscious mind, which was private, and a new \r\ncategory comprising what Romanes called its 'criterion' and Morgan at \r\nfirst called its 'objective manifestations'. This latter category was made \r\nup of 'bodily activities'; not all bodily activities though, only those from \r\nwhich inferences about mind might be made. The procedure of \r\ncomparative psychology now involved three steps. First, one observed \r\none's own mind, then one observed the bodily activities of the other, \r\nand finally one interpreted the latter in the light of the former. It must \r\nbe emphasized that Morgan, and apparently most of his audience, \r\nbelieved that this was how all knowledge of other minds was arrived at, \r\nnot just knowledge of animal minds.5 \r\nBut in the case of animals, especially lower animals, the tenuous \r\nnature of the inferences made tended to become rather obvious.6 The \r\nclass of bodily activities that had served as the 'criterion' of mind, or as \r\nits 'objective manifestations', increasingly attracted attention in its own \r\nright.

The first concerns his extension of the term \"behavior\" \r\nto animals. Morgan's book, Animal Behaviour, published in 1900, was the first \r\nbook ever to use this title and, more importantly, one of the first scientific works \r\nto extend the term \"behavior\" to animals in a sustained way. [The use of this term \r\nwith reference to animals was not entirely unprecedented. For example, Wesley \r\nMills used the term \"behavior\" in relation to animals in a paper he published in 1887 \r\n(Cadwallader, 1984); and, earlier still, Darwin himself made reference to the \r\n\"behaviour of two chimpanzees ... when they were first brought together\" (Darwin, \r\n1872, p. 213).] \r\nOriginally, \"behavior\" had referred to how people conduct themselves in \r\nsociety, and this original moral sense is still apparent in the expressions \r\n\"misbehavior,\" and \"behave yourself!\" In the middle of the nineteenth century, \r\n\"behavior\" was first extended, not to animals, but to the description of physical and \r\nchemical processes, in order to convey a sense of their orderliness, though clearly \r\nnot their intentionality or morality (Ardener, 1973; Williams, 1983). Thus, when \r\nMorgan came to talk of \"animal behavior,\" the word \"behavior\" had already \r\nbecome radically ambivalent in its meaning. Morgan was well aware of this \r\nambivalence, as he took care to explain at the outset of his book: \r\nWe commonly use the word \"behaviour\" with a wide range of meaning. \r\nWe speak of the behaviour of troops in the field, of the prisoner at the bar, \r\nof a dandy in the ball-room. But the chemist and the physicist often speak \r\nof the behaviour of atoms and molecules, or that of a gas under changing \r\nconditions of temperature and pressure.... Frequently employed with a \r\nmoral significance, the word is at least occasionally used in a wider and \r\nmore comprehensive sense. When Mary, the nurse, returns with the little \r\nMiss Smiths from Master Brown's birthday party, she is narrowly ques- \r\ntioned as to their behaviour; but meanwhile their father, the professor, has \r\nbeen discoursing to his students on the behaviour of iron filings in the \r\nmagnetic field; and his son Jack, ofH. M. S. Blunderer, entertains his elder \r\nsisters with a graphic description of the behaviour of a first-class battle- \r\nship in a heavy sea.

According to \r\nMorgan's canon, in no case is \"an animal activity to be interpreted as the outcome \r\nof the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be fairly interpreted as the \r\noutcome of one which stands lower on the psychological scale\" (Dixon, 1892, p. \r\n393). Morgan's contemporaries, and most later authors, have understood the canon \r\nas insisting upon the almost complete elimination of the use of psychological \r\nlanguage in relation to animals and an extreme appeal to the principle of parsimony. \r\nYet its purpose was quite the reverse. \r\nPrior to the canon, Morgan had been engaged in a protracted dispute with \r\nRomanes regarding the latter's proposal for an \"animal psychology.\" Morgan's s \r\ninitial, firmly held position was that a psychological treatment of animal activity \r\nwas methodologically impossible. But he came to change his mind, and the canon \r\nrepresents Morgan's eventual acceptance of Romanes' project (Costall, 1993). Far \r\nfrom prohibiting the psychological description of animal activities, the canon was \r\nintended to provide a framework for a psychological approach to animals. When \r\nMorgan realized his intentions were being misinterpreted, he added the clarifica- \r\ntion that \"the Canon by no means excludes the interpretation of a particular activity \r\nin terms of the higher processes, if we already have independent evidence of the \r\noccurrence of these higher processes in the animal under observation\" (Morgan, \r\n1903, p. 59). Nor, contrary to most accounts, was the canon, in any simple sense. \r\nan appeal to the principle of parsimony - an invitation to be economical with the \r\ntruth. As Morgan insisted, \"Surely the simplicity of an explanation is no necessary \r\ncriterion of its truth\" (Morgan, 1894, p. 54). His serious point was that there were \r\nvery good Darwinian reasons for supposing that animals should vary in the nature \r\nof their mentality. The canon was, therefore, Morgan's attempt to put \"anthropo- \r\nmorphism,\" the psychological approach to animals, on a secure scientific footing \r\n(Costall, 1993). \r\nThe extent to which the intentions of Morgan's canon have been misinterpreted \r\nis astonishing. One recent author has even transformed the canon into a (misspelt) \r\necclesiastical title, referring to a \"Cannon Lloyd Morgan - A Pioneering \r\nPrimatologist\" (Baron-Cohen, 1995, p. 121)! There have been numerous attempts \r\nover the years to set the record straight, in one way or another, about Morgan and \r\nhis canon (Burghardt, 1985; Costall, 1993; Dewsbury, 1979; Gray, 1963; Nagge, \r\n1932; Newbury, 1954; Rollin, 1989, 1990; Singer, 1981; Terrace, 1984).

Animal mentality, he argued, is a positive factor in the \r\nevolutionary process (Morgan, 1896, 1900, 1909; Baldwin, 1902; Belew & \r\nMitchell, 1996; Braestrup, 1971; Hardy, 1965; Richards, 1987). According to the \r\ntheory of organic selection, developed conjointly with J. M. Baldwin, H. F. Osborn, \r\nand E. B. Poulton, individually acquired \"modifications\" not only change the \r\ncontext of subsequent natural selection but do so in such a way that \"congenital \r\nvariations\" coincident with those modifications would be favored. In effect, natural \r\nselection takes on an intelligent direction: \r\nThere is ... a way in which, when natural selection is operative, intelli- \r\ngence may serve to foster congenital variations of the required nature and \r\ndirection. We must remember that acquired habits on the one hand, and \r\ncongenital variations on the other, are both working, in their different \r\nspheres, towards the same end, that of adjustment to the conditions of life. \r\nIf, then, acquired accommodation and congenital adaptation reach this end \r\nby different methods, survival may be best secured by their cooperation.... \r\nAny hereditary variations which coincide in direction with modifications \r\nof behaviour due to acquired habit would be favoured and fostered. \r\n. \r\n(Morgan, 1900, p. 115).2 \r\nIn short, Morgan insisted upon a role for animal mentality and intelligence in \r\nevolution. His credentials as a \"true Darwinian\" (Romanes, 1895) would thus seem \r\nunquestionable.

Despite being immersed for a large \r\npart of his career in university administration (first as Principal of University \r\nCollege, Bristol, and then, very briefly, as Vice Chancellor of the new University \r\nof Bristol he had helped to establish), he continued to be highly productive. The \r\nsheer volume and range of his publications is astonishing (Costall & Clark, 1998). \r\nHis scientific work was taken very seriously indeed. In 1889, he became the first \r\npsychological researcher ever to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society \r\n(Grindley, 1936), and, in 1920, the first President of the newly established \r\nPsychology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. \r\nThe purpose of this paper is not to celebrate Morgan's achievements, however, \r\nbut to examine his role in the transformation that occurred in both biological and \r\npsychological thought, from Darwinism to neo-Darwinism - the negation of \r\nDarwin's revolutionary challenge to the mechanistic assumptions of traditional \r\nscience through the assimilation of Darwinism to that very scheme (Boakes, 1984; \r\nJohnston, 1995; Richards, 1987). Morgan did not initiate these changes and, in \r\nseveral important ways, sought to counter them. And yet he proved pivotal in a \r\nlargely negative way.

According to Darwin, the process of adaptation \r\nwas not to be construed exclusively as a one-sided \"fitting\" of organisms to a pre- \r\nexisting and fixed set of circumstances. Rather animals, through their intelligent \r\nactivities, also shape their circumstances. A fine example of this is to be found in \r\nDarwin's last book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Action of \r\nWorms ( 1881 ), since, of course, the environment of earthworms evolved along with \r\ntheir activity of drawing leaves into the ground. What is more, this activity is an \r\nintelligent one. Dragging a large leaf into a tight burrow is a far from simple task, \r\nyet, as Darwin demonstrated in a remarkable series of experiments, earthworms do \r\nnot act in an haphazard fashion, but usually tug at the most appropriate point even \r\nwhen dealing with unfamiliar leaves or novel shapes cut out of pieces of paper. Here \r\nis Darwin's own conclusion: \r\n[Earthworms] apparently exhibit some degree of intelligence instead of a \r\nmere blind instinctive impulse, in the manner of plugging up their burrows. \r\nThey act in nearly the same manner as would a man, who had to close a \r\ncylindrical tube with different kinds of leaves, petioles, triangles of paper \r\n... for they commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends. (Darwin, \r\n1881, p. 315 ; Reed, 1982) \r\nThe idea that intelligent activity is not simply an outcome but also a positive factor \r\nin the evolutionary process was further developed at the close of the last century by \r\na small number of biologists and psychologists. Challenging the lurch within \r\nevolutionary biology towards mechanism and reductionism, which began shortly \r\nafter Darwin's death, these theorists insisted that animal consciousness had to be \r\nrecognized as having an active role in the evolutionary process.

And, indeed, So-\r\nber’s Canon dispenses with this problem. If higher entails lower (as with\r\nbehavioral capacities), then there is no logical possibility of a higher fac-\r\nulty in the absence of the lower. Sober’s problematic example would also\r\nbe incompatible with my Supervenience Canon reading, I should add.\r\nYet I do not think Sober is correct in assuming that the sole justification\r\nfor the Canon rested with the Method of Variation (MV). Rather, this\r\nMethod itself takes its justification from Morgan’s ideas about emergence.\r\nMorgan thinks the MV is what we expect, given the emergent relationships\r\nbetween higher and lower faculties on Morgan’s psychic ladder. We expect\r\na priori that evolution by natural selection will require the widest latitude\r\nin conferring faculties to organisms in differing degrees in order to meet\r\nthe multifarious ecological problems faced by cognitive beings. But we\r\nalso empirically confirm this armchair presumption: “Hence it is the third\r\nmethod . . . which we should expect a priori to accord most nearly with\r\nthe observed facts. And so far as we can judge from objective observation\r\n. . . this would appear to be the case” (Morgan 1903, 57–58). Kimler\r\nalso notes that Morgan is well aware that we observe “differences in senses\r\nand behaviours. Animals have different minds because they are different\r\nstructurally, and adaptively evolved to solve different ecological problems”\r\n(Kimler 2000, 857). I suggest that the MV is intended to be constrained\r\nby this Emergentist framework, and that is why he is quite right to say\r\nthat given an organism “may be at a stage where certain higher faculties\r\nhave not yet been evolved from their lower precursors,” theorists are\r\n“logically bound not to assume the existence of these higher faculties until\r\ngood reasons shall have been shown for such existence” (Morgan 1903,\r\n59).9 Thus, given an emergence-supervenience thesis, one is logically bound\r\nnot to assume the existence of mind in the absence of the subvenient\r\nconditions.\r\nWith this, I conclude my investigation into Morgan’s intentions.

(2) Is this, or perhaps some other reconstruction, a plausible\r\nguide for our ascriptions of mental states to animals? Here is a rough\r\nsketch of the answers I will defend: As for the first issue, though Morgan\r\nwas certainly not a skeptic about animal minds, comprehension of the\r\nCanon has been hindered because of confusion about what he meant by\r\nthe terms ‘higher’ and ‘lower’. The situation is further complicated because\r\nof Morgan’s occasional restatements of the Canon. However, a close read-\r\ning of his writings strongly suggests continuity of thought. The higher-\r\nlower distinction must be understood in light of Morgan’s tentative and\r\ninchoate idea that higher phenomena, such as mental processes, must\r\n‘emerge from’, that is, ‘supervene on’, lower ‘basal’ conditions.\r\nMorgan’s doctrine of emergence, for which he sometimes uses ‘super-\r\nvenes’ as a cognate, covers both ontogenetic and phylogenetic forms of\r\ndevelopment. Mind emerges in the individual from lower neurophysio-\r\nlogical conditions, and likewise, mind as a general phenomenon gradually\r\nappears on the evolutionary stage. For Morgan, the emergence, or su-\r\npervenience, of mind also encompasses a hierarchical ordering of three\r\nmental faculties, to wit: reason (conceptual thought), which is higher than\r\nintelligence (stimulus-response conditioning), which is higher than mere\r\ninstinct.\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1086/505187 Published online by Cambridge University Press\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:42.893Z","citation":"","pageIndex":2,"uniqueId":"AllMorgans05","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[AllMorgans05]] Allen-HermansonS - 2005 - Morgan's Canon Revisited.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[AllMorgans05]] Allen-HermansonS - 2005 - Morgan's Canon Revisited.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:42.944Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:42.893Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"ed8a2e2b-37c5-4cbf-8c5d-aaec5478fc34","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-09T23:01:49.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:42.855Z","text":"as a call for behaviorism.

The central interpretive issue concerns\r\nthe distinction between higher and lower mental faculties. What is meant\r\nby this, and the ‘psychological scale’ Morgan speaks of? Morgan’s actual\r\nposition has become more, rather than less, obscured by recent scholar-\r\nship, and as a result, the Canon has come to be used rather like a mirror,\r\nreflecting and reinforcing the preconceptions brought before it. On the\r\none hand, it has been championed by behaviorists who treat it as a cognate\r\nfor methodological parsimony,1 and, concomitantly, a “refutation of the\r\nDarwin-Romanes view of the continuity of mentation . . . and conse-\r\nquently, as a denial of consciousness to animals” (Rollin 1989, 75). This\r\nsort of depiction is easily found, as in this introduction to comparative\r\npsychology:\r\nConsider the case of a butterfly’s orientation toward a source of light.\r\nThe parsimony principle [i.e., Morgan’s Canon] would favour an\r\nexplanation in terms of the action of a preprogrammed mechanism\r\n(called “tropism”) that attracts the insect towards lighted spots, rather\r\nthan an interpretation invoking, for example, the butterfly’s curiosity.\r\n(Vauclair 1996, 3)\r\nHowever, many cognitive ethologists and philosophers also defend the\r\nCanon, but on the quite different grounds that it is not inimical to animal\r\nmentality, and in fact serves as “a welcome prophylactic against senti-\r\nmental and unwarranted attributions of finer sensibilities to our favorite\r\nanimals” (Wilder 1996, 35).\r\nOver the years, commentators—including Newbury (1954), Radner and\r\nRadner (1989), Thomas (1998), and Kimler (2000)—have repeatedly\r\npointed out that psychologists are in error when they interpret the Canon\r\nas a call for behaviorism. Skinner (1938), Boring (1950), Vauclair (1996),\r\nand many others2 have incorrectly interpreted the Canon as a call for\r\nexplanatory simplicity, parsimony, and/or Ockham’s razor. Other recent\r\nauthors have argued that considerations of parsimony actually lead to-\r\nwards, not away from, mentalism.3 Morgan would have agreed that the\r\nsimplest hypothesis is that other organisms are just like us. But it is\r\nprecisely for this reason that his Canon is not intended as a form of\r\n1. I.e., find the simplest theory that accounts for all the evidence (Sober 1988).\r\n2. Thomas (2001) is a systematic compilation of the various and pervasive misrepre-\r\nsentations of the canon within psychology.\r\n3. Regan (1983), Rollin (1989), Bekoff and Allen (1997), and Sober (2001) have in-\r\ndependently argued that considerations of parsimony lead towards mentalism, not\r\nbehaviorism.\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1086/505187 Published online by Cambridge University Press\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:42.798Z","citation":"","pageIndex":1,"uniqueId":"AllMorgans05","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[AllMorgans05]] Allen-HermansonS - 2005 - Morgan's Canon Revisited.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[AllMorgans05]] Allen-HermansonS - 2005 - Morgan's Canon Revisited.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:42.855Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:42.798Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"e8feaed8-3495-4f65-852b-4da5fde3f6d6","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-09T22:40:35.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:03.401Z","text":"When we consider how widespread—indeed, almost univer-\r\nsal—is imitation among animals of the middle and higher grades,\r\nthat it is difficult so to separate it from the general psychic life of\r\nthe animal as to be able fairly to analyze their mental processes\r\nand determine how much is due to independent development fer\r\nse and how much to imitation, one cannot but marvel at the de-\r\ngree to which that magic word of modern science ' experiment'\r\ncan blind the mind to facts thick as the leaves of the forest, and\r\nall pointing to the importance of imitation in animal life.

Even those curves which in the case of the cats and\r\ndogs only serve to stereotype error are possibly of some value\r\nwhen applied to the chicks. Says Dr. Thorndike: \" I hate\r\nto burden the reader with the disgusting rhetoric which would\r\nresult if I had to insist on particularizations and reservations at\r\nevery step.\" If anything, just such particulars might have some-\r\nwhat redeemed these experiments. They might at least have\r\nproved helpful in some way. At the present stage of compara-\r\ntive psychology we are in need of observations down to the\r\nminutest details. We can better spare the rhetoric.\r\nWhen we consider how widespread—indeed, almost univer-\r\nsal—is imitation among animals of the middle and higher grades,\r\nthat it is difficult so to separate it from the general psychic life of\r\nthe animal as to be able fairly to analyze their mental processes\r\nand determine how much is due to independent development fer\r\nse and how much to imitation, one cannot but marvel at the de-\r\ngree to which that magic word of modern science ' experiment'\r\ncan blind the mind to facts thick as the leaves of the forest, and\r\nall pointing to the importance of imitation in animal life. So\r\nobvious an example of imitation as the talking of parrots is set\r\naside or twisted out of all recognition. It is, moreover, a case of\r\nheads I win, tails you lose. Much that Dr. Thorndike has said\r\nwhen discussing this subject is valuable as suggesting a basis\r\nfor observation and on the genesis of imitation, though this ap-\r\nplies also to human psychology. There is one fallacy that un-\r\nderlies the whole of Dr. Thorndike's experimenting and vitiates\r\nhis conclusions, namely, this: that he overlooks the many pos-\r\nsible and actual inhibitions to response to a stimulus.

If\r\nwe take intelligence in its objective, biological or teleological\r\nsense, i. e., the power of the organism to adapt itself to new\r\nenvironment, the development of intelligence in these first four\r\nweeks is readily followed. At birth we see a larval organism, en¬\r\ndowed with slight power of movement, insufficient to secure food\r\nand warmth, or to avoid danger, insensitive toall external excita¬\r\ntions except temperature and odors, endowed with no psychic life\r\nbeyond desire, and pleasure and pain. Gradually we see this\r\norganism change from its larval appearance to a form indicative\r\nof energy and activity. As the neuro-muscular system de¬\r\nvelops, all those instinctive activities so necessary to life appear\r\none by one ; and with the anatomical and functional develop¬\r\nment of the several sense-organs, advances, pari passu, the\r\nsensational horizon. The repertory of motor and emotional\r\ninstincts, functional and psychic traits is rapidly filled out; and\r\nat the end of the fourth week of life, we have the young rat\r\nin full possession of that power to learn by experience, to seek\r\nout advantageous things, and to avoid dangerous things, which\r\nwe call intelligence. Little would be gained here by attempting\r\nto resolve any specific process of intelligence into its elements.\r\nThe one case of imitation noted is an example: the young rat\r\nsaw the mother doing a certain thing and did it himself. The\r\nmost obvious explanation of this process is that the visual\r\nimage of what the young rat saw touched off a motor impulse\r\nresulting in similar action; but the explanation is superficial—\r\nit fails to touch the most important part of the question—how\r\nthe visual image connects with the motor image, or impulse.\r\nSimilarly, the complex mental process involved in the action of\r\nthe rat that pushed his fellow away from a dish of milk in\r\norder to have free access himself, could receive only a super¬\r\nficial explanation in associational terms.\r\nFinally, the chief value of a study of this kind is not in the\r\nanalysis of the intellectual processes, valuable as that may be,\r\nbut rather in getting a picture of the psychic make-up of the\r\nanimal—an insight into his character through an appreciation\r\nof his fundamental psychic traits, which persist with undimin¬\r\nished vigor through the vicissitudes of an environment dif¬\r\nferent in all its factors from that of the free wild life in which\r\nhis psychic nexus was woven in the loom of necessity.\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.072Z","citation":"","pageIndex":21,"uniqueId":"SmaNotes99","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[SmaNotes99]] SmallW - 1899 - Notes on the Psychic Development of the Young White Rat.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[SmaNotes99]] SmallW - 1899 - Notes on the Psychic Development of the Young White Rat.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.317Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.072Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"e3d723cb-de70-4d42-a8c4-710f39eb0a7c","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-09T22:10:40.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.242Z","text":"Intelligence.

If\r\nwe take intelligence in its objective, biological or teleological\r\nsense, i. e., the power of the organism to adapt itself to new\r\nenvironment, the development of intelligence in these first four\r\nweeks is readily followed. At birth we see a larval organism, en¬\r\ndowed with slight power of movement, insufficient to secure food\r\nand warmth, or to avoid danger, insensitive toall external excita¬\r\ntions except temperature and odors, endowed with no psychic life\r\nbeyond desire, and pleasure and pain. Gradually we see this\r\norganism change from its larval appearance to a form indicative\r\nof energy and activity. As the neuro-muscular system de¬\r\nvelops, all those instinctive activities so necessary to life appear\r\none by one ; and with the anatomical and functional develop¬\r\nment of the several sense-organs, advances, pari passu, the\r\nsensational horizon. The repertory of motor and emotional\r\ninstincts, functional and psychic traits is rapidly filled out; and\r\nat the end of the fourth week of life, we have the young rat\r\nin full possession of that power to learn by experience, to seek\r\nout advantageous things, and to avoid dangerous things, which\r\nwe call intelligence. Little would be gained here by attempting\r\nto resolve any specific process of intelligence into its elements.\r\nThe one case of imitation noted is an example: the young rat\r\nsaw the mother doing a certain thing and did it himself. The\r\nmost obvious explanation of this process is that the visual\r\nimage of what the young rat saw touched off a motor impulse\r\nresulting in similar action; but the explanation is superficial—\r\nit fails to touch the most important part of the question—how\r\nthe visual image connects with the motor image, or impulse.\r\nSimilarly, the complex mental process involved in the action of\r\nthe rat that pushed his fellow away from a dish of milk in\r\norder to have free access himself, could receive only a super¬\r\nficial explanation in associational terms.\r\nFinally, the chief value of a study of this kind is not in the\r\nanalysis of the intellectual processes, valuable as that may be,\r\nbut rather in getting a picture of the psychic make-up of the\r\nanimal—an insight into his character through an appreciation\r\nof his fundamental psychic traits, which persist with undimin¬\r\nished vigor through the vicissitudes of an environment dif¬\r\nferent in all its factors from that of the free wild life in which\r\nhis psychic nexus was woven in the loom of necessity.\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.072Z","citation":"","pageIndex":21,"uniqueId":"SmaNotes99","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[SmaNotes99]] SmallW - 1899 - Notes on the Psychic Development of the Young White Rat.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[SmaNotes99]] SmallW - 1899 - Notes on the Psychic Development of the Young White Rat.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.317Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.072Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"b1412231-d987-4152-ad9f-512cc8d5e3a7","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-09T22:08:40.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.011Z","text":"Sucking.

At this stage they are veritably “lieblichste Thierchen”—most fascinating little creatures. Their rapidity of movement is\r\nmarvellous. The plays certainly cover a great many of the serious\r\nactivities of adult life—including those of sex. They show no striking\r\nfear of me yet. Occasionally they run away after sniffing my hands,\r\nbut this seems to be as much in sport as in fear.\r\nRemarks on the Diary.\r\nProf. Mills, in his remarks upon the psychic development of his\r\npuppies, says : ‘4 The facts most striking in the first few days\r\nof life are the frequent desire to suck, the perfect ability to\r\nreach the teats of the dam just after birth, the misery evident\r\nunder cold and hunger, and the fact that the greater part of\r\nexistence is spent in the sleeping state.” This statement is\r\nequally true of the young rats, if we add the facts of their rapid\r\ngrowth and change from the larval appearance, and of their\r\nvocal accomplishments. The desire for warmth and the desire\r\nfor food seem to be their very first psychic experiences in life; the\r\nformer preceding in time and being more imperative. A special\r\nsignificance of this fact will be noted later.\r\nSucking. Prof. Mills discusses fully the first character of this\r\nreaction, and concludes that it is not a “ congenitally perfect or\r\ninstinctive action ” as the sucking is not perfect at first,” but\r\n4 ‘ is improved with practice. 5 ’ My observations upon the young\r\nrats accord perfectly with the conclusions of Prof. Mills. The\r\nyoung rats find the teats largely by accident, aided by the\r\nmother who pushes and pulls them under her. I have not seen\r\nthem attempt to suck other parts of the mother’s body—the fur,—as did Prof. Mills’s puppies.1 I am also of the opinion\r\nthat smell plays no very important part in finding the teats at\r\nthis early period. It is rather that they are attracted by the\r\nwarmth of the mother’s belly and find the teats accidentally.\r\nSensation. The infancy of the rat falls naturally into two\r\ndistinct divisions : the period before the opening of the eyes and\r\nears, and the period following this event. As noted in the\r\ndiary the ears and eyes open almost simultaneously, from the\r\n1Since writing this sentence I have seen a six-days-old rat sucking\r\nthe mother’s fur.\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:04.989Z","citation":"","pageIndex":9,"uniqueId":"SmaNotes99","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[SmaNotes99]] SmallW - 1899 - Notes on the Psychic Development of the Young White Rat.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[SmaNotes99]] SmallW - 1899 - Notes on the Psychic Development of the Young White Rat.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:05.011Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:04.989Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"e1aac0b6-0577-4927-84bc-80ef47871e89","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-09T22:07:16.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:04.862Z","text":"vation.

The\r\nperiod after that, and before puberty, is childhood.\r\nIn all the higher mammals, at least, there are analogous\r\nperiods of development. Doubtless there are wide variations\r\nin the distributions of these periods, even between closely\r\nallied families as, e. g., the guinea-pig and the rat. The guinea-\r\npig’s infancy is almost wholly intra-uterine,—he is born with\r\nneuro-muscular and sensory apparatus almost perfectly de¬\r\nveloped. The rat, on the other hand, does not reach a like\r\ndegree of development until about the third week of life, or even\r\nlater.\r\nThe diary covers the period of infancy of the white rat, i. ^.,\r\nthe period up to the time when the sense organs were working\r\nnormally, and the muscular movements were all perfectly co-ordi¬\r\nnated. The subsequent period has received only casual obser¬\r\nvation. The summary and inferences have the supplementary\r\nevidence of general observations covering a period of nearly two\r\nyears.\r\nDay i. The rats at birth are bright red, ugly and helpless little\r\ncreatures. The average weight is 5 grams. Average length: of body,\r\n4.2 cm. ; head, 1.2 cm. ; tail, 1.4 cm. The skin is thin and delicate,\r\nand absolutely destitute of hair. There is no external ear—only a\r\ndermal fold. No external eye—a slight protuberance. The nose is\r\npretty well developed—a spongy-looking bulb, armed with short deli¬\r\ncate feelers. The nostrils are completely open, but very small—about\r\nmm. in diameter. Mouth is a mere sucking disk. No rudimentary\r\nteeth. Their movements, except sucking, are inco-ordinated, yet pur¬\r\nposive. Sucking they accomplish lying on their backs and sides, the\r\nmother crouchingover them. They keepconstantly under the mother’s\r\nbody. When held in the hand they roll up in a ball. If placed upon\r\ntheir backs they hitch and kick and wriggle over upon the belly or\r\nside. They are generally unable to maintain the belly position for\r\nany length of time and fall over upon their sides in a ludicrous man¬\r\nner. When lying upon the belly, they stretch out their paws in a\r\nturtle-like way. Move their tails.\r\nI distinguish three vocal efforts : a sort of clucking sound ; a fine\r\nwire-like squeak (hunger?) ; and a sort of chirp, short and sharp.\r\nI tested for reactions to smell, taste, and tactual stimuli.\r\nSmell, 5 rats. All sensed violet, as indicated by expressive move¬\r\nments. Reaction, slow—about 15 seconds. One only objected : threw\r\nup head and made convulsive movements with fore paws. All showed\r\ndislike to cheese, if movement away could be so interpreted. In¬\r\nstantaneous convulsive reaction to HC1.\r\nTaste. Tested with sugar-solution, warm milk, and strong salt solu¬\r\ntion. These were applied to lips with fine brush. In each case, the\r\nrats squeaked and wiped at the offending stuff with fore paws. Move¬\r\nments rather inco-ordinated. The movements are: brushing and push¬\r\ning away with the fore paws ; averting the head ; movement of the\r\nwhole body. In case of the salt solution, the reactions were more\r\nvigorous, accompanied by voiding of urine.\r\nClear water called out the same characteristic reactions.\r\nFrom this similarity of response, I infer that there is no differentia¬\r\ntion of tastes, as pleasant and unpleasant. They are all unpleasant.\r\nJournal,—6\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:04.753Z","citation":"","pageIndex":2,"uniqueId":"SmaNotes99","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[SmaNotes99]] SmallW - 1899 - Notes on the Psychic Development of the Young White Rat.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[SmaNotes99]] SmallW - 1899 - Notes on the Psychic Development of the Young White Rat.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:04.862Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:04.753Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"64bb3d6b-891c-44ce-bd83-8a2c0beee754","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T13:56:28.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:56.220Z","text":"But when we try to say why rein-\r\nforcement has this effect, theories arise.\r\nLearning is said to take place because\r\nthe reinforcement is pleasant, satisfying,\r\ntension reducing, and so on.

By chang-\r\ning to this problem, it was possible to\r\nchange the bird's behavior as shown be-\r\ntween the two vertical lines in the fig-\r\nure. The upper curve between these\r\nlines shows the decline in matching re-\r\nsponses which had resulted from the\r\ncolor preference. The lower curve be-\r\ntween the same lines shows the develop-\r\nment of responding to and matching the\r\nopposite color. At the second vertical\r\nline the reinforcement was again made\r\ncontingent upon matching. The upper\r\ncurve shows the reestablishment of\r\nmatching behavior while the lower curve\r\nshows a decline in striking the opposite\r\ncolor. The result was a true solution:\r\nthe pigeon struck the sample, no mat-\r\nter what its color, and then the corre-\r\nsponding side key.

It seems to follow\r\nthe same rule as in the case of choos-\r\ning: changes in the distribution of re-\r\nsponses between two keys do not in-\r\nvolve the over-all rate of responding to\r\na key. This mean rate will not remain\r\nconstant under the spurious solution\r\nachieved with a color preference, as at\r\nthe beginning of this figure.\r\nThese experiments on a few higher\r\nprocesses have necessarily been very\r\nbriefly described. They are not of-\r\nfered as proving that theories of learn-\r\ning are not necessary, but they may\r\nsuggest an alternative program in this\r\ndifficult area. The data in the field of\r\nthe higher mental processes transcend\r\nsingle responses or single stimulus-re-\r\nsponse relationships. But they appear\r\nto be susceptible to formulation in terms\r\nof the differentiation of concurrent re-\r\nsponses, the discrimination of stimuli,\r\nthe establishment of various sequences\r\nof responses, and so on. There seems\r\nto be no a priori reason why a complete\r\naccount is not possible without appeal\r\nto theoretical processes in other dimen-\r\nsional systems.\r\nConclusion\r\nPerhaps to do without theories alto-\r\ngether is a tour de force that is too\r\nmuch to expect as a general practice.\r\nTheories are fun. But it is possible\r\nthat the most rapid progress toward an\r\nunderstanding of learning may be made\r\nby research that is not designed to test\r\ntheories. An adequate impetus is sup-\r\nplied by the inclination to obtain data\r\nshowing orderly changes characteristic\r\nof the learning process. An acceptable\r\nscientific program is to collect data of\r\nthis sort and to relate them to ma-\r\nnipulable variables, selected for study\r\nthrough a common sense exploration of\r\nthe field.\r\nThis does not exclude the possibility\r\nof theory in another sense.

If this be the case even in natural philosophy,\r\nhow much more in moral, where there is a much greater complication of cir-\r\ncumstances, and where those views and sentiments, which are essential to any\r\naction of the mind, are so implicit and obscure, that they often escape our\r\nstrictest attention, and are not only unaccountable in their causes, but even\r\nunknown in their existence? I am much afraid, lest the small success I meet with\r\nin my enquiries will make this observation bear the air of an apology rather than\r\nof boasting.\r\n12 If any thing can give me security in this particular, ’twill be the enlarging the\r\nsphere of my experiments as much as possible; for which reason it may be proper\r\nin this place to examine the reasoning faculty of brutes, as well as that of human\r\ncreatures.\r\nSect. 16. Of the reason of animals\r\n1 Next to the ridicule of denying an evident truth, is that of taking much pains to\r\ndefend it; and no truth appears to me more evident, than that beasts are endow’d\r\nwith thought and reason as well as men. The arguments are in this case so\r\nobvious, that they never escape the most stupid and ignorant.\r\n2 We are conscious, that we ourselves, in adapting means to ends, are guided by\r\nreason and design, and that ’tis not ignorantly nor casually we perform those\r\nactions, which tend to self-preservation, to the obtaining pleasure, and avoiding\r\npain. When therefore we see other creatures, in millions of instances, perform\r\nlike actions, and direct them to like ends, all our principles of reason and prob-\r\nability carry us with an invincible force to believe the existence of a like cause.\r\n’Tis needless in my opinion to illustrate this argument by the enumeration of\r\nparticulars. The smallest attention will supply us with more than are requisite.\r\nThe resemblance betwixt the actions of animals and those of men is so entire in\r\nthis respect, that the very first action of the first animal we shall please to pitch\r\non, will afford us an incontestable argument for the present doctrine.\r\n3 This doctrine is as useful as it is obvious, and furnishes us with a kind of\r\ntouchstone, by which we may try every system in this species of philosophy. ’Tis\r\nfrom the resemblance of the external actions of animals to those we ourselves\r\nperform, that we judge their internal likewise to resemble ours; and the same\r\nprinciple of reasoning, carry’d one step farther, will make us conclude that since\r\nour internal actions resemble each other, the causes, from which they are deriv’d,\r\nmust also be resembling. When any hypothesis, therefore, is advanc’d to explain\r\na mental operation, which is common to men and beasts, we must apply the same\r\nhypothesis to both; and as every true hypothesis will abide this trial, so I may\r\nventure to affirm, that no false one will ever be able to endure it. The common\r\ndefect of those systems, which philosophers have employ’d to account for the\r\nactions of the mind, is, that they suppose such a subtility and refinement of\r\nthought, as not only exceeds the capacity of mere animals, but even of children\r\nand the common people in our own species; who are notwithstanding suscep-\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:31:10.788Z","citation":"","pageIndex":134,"uniqueId":"HNNDavid07","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[HNNDavid07]] HumeD et al - 2007 - David Hume - A Treatise of Human Nature - Volume 1 - Texts.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[HNNDavid07]] HumeD et al - 2007 - David Hume - A Treatise of Human Nature - Volume 1 - Texts.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:31:10.826Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:10.788Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"9642defd-b46d-43dd-b172-6781edb0af69","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T04:47:54.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:21.096Z","text":"It should be noted that Singer also seems to hold much the same notion \r\nas that presented here of behavior as such and of purpose as one of its most \r\nfundamental characters.

For \r\nwhereas, for Professor Perry and for us, purpose is a purely \r\nobjectively defined variable, which is defined by the facts of \r\ntrial and error and of resultant docility; for Professor Mc- \r\nDougall, purpose seems to be an introspectively defined sub¬ \r\njective ‘somewhat,’ which is a something other, and more than, \r\nthe manner in which it appears in behavior; it is a “psychic,” \r\n“mentalistic” somewhat, behind such objective appearances, and \r\nto be known in the last analysis through introspection only. This \r\ndifference between our point of view and McDougall’s is funda¬ \r\nmental and implies a bouleversement complet.27 \r\n9. The Objective Definition of Behavior Cognitions \r\nConsider, now, the fact of cognition. The docility feature of \r\nbehavior also objectively defines, we shall declare, certain im¬ \r\nmediate, immanent characters for which the generic name cogni¬ \r\ntions or cognition-processes is appropriate. More specifically, our \r\ncontention will be that the characteristic patterns of preferred \r\nroutes and of commerces-with which identify any given behavior- \r\nin mere trial and error and in mere persistence-until, irrespective of whether \r\nor not these tended to produce resultant learning. This seems to us now, how¬ \r\never, an error. We have come to accept Professor Perry’s dictum as to the \r\nneed of docility for a true definition of purpose. It is only because there is \r\nimplied in the category of trial and error and of persistence-until the further \r\ncategory of a resultant docility that trial and error and persistence-until have \r\nthe meaning they do. Mere variability of response which involved no resultant \r\nselection among the “tries” would not be one’s ordinary notion of “trial and \r\nerror.” Nor would mere keeping-on-ness seem a real “persistence-until.” It is \r\nonly when such variations and such persistences have implicit within them the \r\nfurther character of a resultant selection of the more efficient of the tries \r\n(i.e., docility) that they have their usual significance and are to be said to \r\ndefine purpose. \r\nIt should be noted that Singer also seems to hold much the same notion \r\nas that presented here of behavior as such and of purpose as one of its most \r\nfundamental characters.

Behaviorisms and Behaviorisms \r\nThe general position adopted in this essay will be that of be¬ \r\nhaviorism, but it will be a behaviorism of a rather special variety, \r\nfor there are behaviorisms and behaviorisms. Watson, the \r\narch-behaviorist, proposed one brand. But others, particularly \r\nHolt, Perry, Singer, de Laguna, Hunter, Weiss, Lashley, arid \r\nFrost, have since all offered other rather different varieties.3 No \r\ncomplete analysis and comparison of all these can be attempted. \r\nWe shall here present merely certain distinctive features as a \r\nway of introducing what is to be our own variety. \r\n3. Watson: The Molecular Definition \r\nWatson, in most places, seems to describe behavior in terms \r\nof simple stimulus-response connections. And these stimuli and \r\nthese responses he also seems to conceive in relatively immediate \r\nphysical and physiological terms. Thus, in the first complete \r\nstatement of his doctrine, he wrote: \r\n“We use the term stimulus in psychology as it is used in physi¬ \r\nology. Only in psychology we have to extend somewhat the usage \r\nof the term. In the psychological laboratory, when we are dealing \r\nwith relatively simple factors, such as the effect of ether waves \r\nof different lengths, the effect of sound waves, etc., and are at¬ \r\ntempting to isolate their effects upon the adjustment of men, we \r\nspeak of stimuli. On the other hand, when factors leading to \r\nreactions are more complex, as, for example, in the social world, \r\nprogress as a too simple contest between “movements” (cf. E. G. Boring, Psy¬ \r\nchology for Eclectics, Psychologies of 1930 [Worcester, Mass., Clark Univ. \r\nPress, 1930], pp. 115-127). But the temptation is too great. \r\n8 W. McDougall (Men or Robots, Psychologies of 1925 [Worcester, Mass., \r\nClark Univ. Press, 1926], p. 277) declares that he was the first to define psy¬ \r\nchology as the study of behavior. He says: “As long ago as 1905 I began my \r\nattempt to remedy this state of affairs [i.e., the inadequacies of an “Idea” \r\npsychology] by proposing to define psychology as the positive science of con¬ \r\nduct, using the word ‘positive’ to distinguish it from ethics, the normative sci¬ \r\nence of conduct.” Cf. also, his Psychology, the Study of Behavior (New York, \r\nHenry Holt and Company, 1912), p. 19, “We may then define psychology as \r\nthe positive science of the behavior of living things.” But the credit or discredit \r\nfor the raising of this definition of psychology to an ism must certainly be \r\ngiven to Watson (Psychology as a behaviorist views it, Psychol. Rev., 1913, \r\n20, 158-177; Image and affection in behavior, /. Philos. Psychol. Sci. Meth., \r\n1913, 10, 421-428).

One can point\r\nto but very few contemporary authors who explicitly maintain this\r\npurely hormic psychology1. By other authors who recognize the hormic\r\nprinciple, it is commonly combined with hedonism. Some actions are\r\ninterpreted hormically, others hedonically. Ward, Stout, Freud and\r\nF. L. Wells come to mind as prominent instances. In a recent article2\r\nI have pointed out how Freud has inclined in his later writings to give\r\nprimacy to the hormic principle, and to make less of his ‘pleasure\r\nprinciple.’ Freud’s psychology seems to me to show clearly that this\r\ncombination of the two principles, the attempt to run them in double\r\nharness, results in confusion and error, both theoretical and practical.\r\nMy purpose in this paper is to try to show that a purely hormic\r\npsychology is tenable. I do not dwell upon the difficulties of pure hedon¬\r\nism. They have frequently been pointed out and never overcome. I am\r\nconcerned rather to consider the more obvious of the difficulties in the\r\nway of a purely hormic view. Before considering these difficulties let\r\nme briefly point out the superiority of the hormic principle to the hedonic\r\nin face of the major types of activity.\r\nWhen we act with purpose in the fullest sense, when we set before\r\nourselves a goal and with clear consciousness of it as the object of desire,\r\nchoose means towards it and pursue those means, progress towards our\r\ngoal brings pleasure or satisfaction no matter how hard the labour; and\r\nattainment brings satisfaction which is the greater, the keener the desire\r\nthat moved us and the more strenous the efforts we have made. The\r\ngoal in itself may be of little or no intrinsic value ; it may be the barren\r\nand shapeless top of a mountain enshrouded in thick mist. But we have\r\ndesired it, have striven for it, have attained it, and pleasure or satisfac¬\r\ntion results. On the other hand, as we strive, every check, every thwart¬\r\ning brings unpleasure, and final failure leaves us steeped in gloom.\r\nThe principle here enunciated is widely recognized as a general law\r\nof conation, even by some of those who accept also the hedonic principle.\r\nJames Ward, for example, made subjective or hedonic selection funda¬\r\nmental in his psychology; he wrote: “The broad generalization already\r\nmade may hold, viz. that receptive states lead through feeling to active\r\nstates, and that those which are neither pleasant nor unpleasant, that\r\n1 Dr E. Rignano is the only one who comes to my mind as explicitly maintaining a\r\npurely hormic view. Cf. his essay on “The Origin of the Affective Tendencies” in Essays in\r\nScientific Synthesis.

Jung also.\r\n2 “A Great Advance of the Freudian Psychology,” Joum. of Abnormal and Social\r\nPsychology, 1925, xx.\r\nCopyright (c) 2003 ProQuest Information and Learning Company\r\nCopyright (c) British Psychological Society\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:27:48.143Z","citation":"","pageIndex":1,"uniqueId":"McDPleasure27","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[McDPleasure27]] McDougallW - 1927 - Pleasure, Pain and Conation.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[McDPleasure27]] McDougallW - 1927 - Pleasure, Pain and Conation.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:27:48.155Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:48.143Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"04a73b12-5259-4bb1-aab0-fdbafeabceb6","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T03:29:57.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:48.078Z","text":"Throughout the nineteenth century psychology was largely dominated\r\nby the theory of psychological hedonism, the theory that in some sense\r\npleasure and pain are the source or grounds or cause of all mental\r\nactivity, of all conation.

At the same time, he did not make \r\npsychology the exclusive preserve of the behaviorist; he reserved some \r\nrole for the introspectionist. \r\nWilliam McDougall, later to be a vocal opponent of behaviorism, \r\nwas the first psychologist to use the term behavior when defining psy­\r\nchology. In words reminiscent of those Watson was to publish five \r\nyears later, he wrote that “The insistence upon introspection as the \r\none method of the science [of psychology] tended to prolong the pre-\r\ndominance of this narrow and paralyzing view of the scope of the sci­\r\nence.”40 McDougall went on to write that “psychologists must cease \r\nto be content with the sterile and narrow conception of their science \r\nas the science of consciousness, and must boldly assert its claim to be \r\nthe positive science of the mind in all its aspects and modes of func­\r\ntioning or . . . the positive science of conduct or behavior.”41 Although \r\nthat passage, taken in isolation, might suggest that McDougall had \r\npreempted Watson, we cannot classify McDougall as a behaviorist. \r\nHis repudiation of introspection was part of his repudiation of hedo­\r\nnism, associationism, utilitarianism, and individualism (so that he \r\nwas distancing himself from an intellectual tradition that is fully com­\r\npatible with behaviorism’s) and was designed to set the stage for an \r\nexamination of the forces underlying conduct. \r\nWalter Bowers Pillsbury (1872–1960), although a student of the \r\narch-introspectionist Edward Bradford Titchener, nevertheless de-\r\nfined psychology as the scientific study of behavior.42 Like Cattell, \r\nPillsbury wished to match his definition of psychology to what he \r\ntook to be the new science’s actual achievements and its potential for \r\nenhancing social and psychological efficiency.

XIII, No. 22. OCTOBER 26, 1916 \r\nTHE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY \r\nPSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS \r\nBEHAVIOR AND THE CONCEPT OF MENTAL DISEASE \r\nFOR some years I have been attempting to understand the phy- \r\nsician's concept of mental diseases. Not long ago I had the \r\npleasure of attending a medical meeting and of listening to a phy- \r\nsician who has been very successful in his treatment of neurasthenia. \r\nSeveral cases of neurasthenia were described. Since none of the \r\npatients showed general organic disturbances of a serious kind and \r\nsince all of the neurological tests showed normal functioning of the \r\nreflexes of the central nervous system, the physician concluded that \r\nthe disease was \"purely mental.\" He then began to describe the \r\ncondition of such a patient's ego-the general content of conscious- \r\nness, the inward reference of attention, and the peculiarities of the \r\nfield of attention. At the end of his discourse two or three eminent \r\nphysicians stated their satisfaction that the speaker had been willing \r\nto come out clearly and say that the disease was \"mental.\" In \r\nother words, they expressed their approval of the fact that the \r\nspeaker did not, in functional nervous cases, deem it necessary to \r\nfind lesions in the central nervous system or even a toxic condition \r\nof the nervous system before admitting that the patient had a \r\ndisease. \r\nBeing the only psychologist present, I did not like to admit that \r\nI did not understand the physician's use of the term \"mental.\" (I \r\ndo not wish by this assertion to stir up strife or bitter argument, \r\nbut rather to confess ignorance on my own part and to seek for some \r\ncommon ground of discussion.) As a sequel to this meeting I began to \r\nattempt to formulate my own ideas as to the terminology I should use \r\nin describing a mental disease. I think that at the outset I should \r\nadmit that I know a good deal more about terminology than I know \r\nabout diseases of any kind. I am strengthened in this attempt to \r\ngive my concept of mental diseases by the difficulty I have had in \r\nunderstanding the terminology (involving throughout and often \r\ntranscending the current concept of consciousness) of the psycho- \r\nanalytic movement. \r\nI have been for some years an earnest student of Freud (and \r\nother psychoanalysts), but the further I go into their terminology \r\n589 \r\nThis content downloaded from 194.29.185.203 on Sat, 24 May 2014 16:01:47 PM\r\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:31:22.102Z","citation":"","pageIndex":1,"uniqueId":"WatBehavior16","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[WatBehavior16]] WatsonJ - 1916 - Behavior and the Concept of Mental Disease.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[WatBehavior16]] WatsonJ - 1916 - Behavior and the Concept of Mental Disease.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:31:22.144Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:22.102Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"e24e5aa1-524d-42a5-88be-2485a3ea589c","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T03:04:29.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:20.139Z","text":"The article gives clear premonitions of the future direction of Wat­\r\non’s thinking, whereas “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It” and \r\nImage and Affection in Behavior” do not.

Furthermore, the Harpers \r\narticle was directed at the lay public, the same audience to whom, \r\neventually, he would direct his behaviorist doctrine. Watson appeared \r\nto have been hedging his bets—preaching an enlarged version of com­\r\nparative psychology to academics and a form of social technology to \r\nthe public at large. \r\nUp to this point I have been arguing that Watson, at least until \r\n1913, equated behaviorism with comparative psychology. I have also \r\nargued that behaviorism as a doctrine or theory was the exclusive pos­\r\nsession neither of Watson nor of psychology, since versions of behav­\r\niorism pervasively underpinned American social science from the end \r\nof the 1890s to the 1920s. At the same time, Watson did eventually \r\nbecome a behaviorist in the usual sense of the term. However, it is ex­\r\nceedingly difficult to discover when and in what form he enunciated \r\nhis doctrine for the first time. Indeed, it seems that classical, overar­\r\nching behaviorism crept upon him like a thief in the night.57 \r\nWatson, I suggest, first stated his classically behaviorist principles \r\nin an article entitled “Behavior and the Concept of Mental Disease,” \r\npublished in 1916.58 The article is diffuse and tentative. Fortunately, \r\nwe know quite a lot about the circumstances in which it came to be \r\nwritten, allowing us to understand what Watson meant by “behav­\r\niorism” in 1916 and his conception of its role in psychology.

A monochromatic light \r\nproduces no such effect. If, however, the light is allowed to fall \r\nupon the retina of the eye at the moment the foot is stimulated elec- \r\ntrically, we will (after repetition) bring about a condition such that \r\nthe light alone will produce the defensive reaction of the foot. Words \r\nas words are learned largely by imitation, but words receive their \r\nstanding as functional units in integrated habit systems by virtue \r\nof the fact that they become substitutable for the stimulus which \r\noriginally initiated an act. A simple illustration will possibly serve \r\nto make clear my point. The cold air from an open window leads a \r\nchild who has gone to bed to draw up the covers. The words of the \r\nnurse \"cover up, dear\" will lead to the same act. Of course in \r\nhabit systems as complex as those in speech, words get further and \r\nfurther divorced from the original stimuli for which they were sub- \r\nstituted (i. e., from the original integrations in which they first \r\nplayed a part). The final test of all words, however, is the question \r\nwhether they can stand adequately (be substituted) for acts. We \r\noften see an instructor despair of telling a student in words how to \r\nconduct an experiment. He then resorts to acts and goes through \r\nthe experiment for the student. Our words thus stand as a kind of \r\nshorthand sketch of our repertoire of acts and motor attitudes. \r\nI have developed these points at length because a great many of \r\nthe symptoms of so-called mental cases consist in disturbances of \r\nspeech functions-in maladjustments of that nice balance which \r\nshould exist between speech acts and bodily acts (and, perhaps even \r\nmore, disturbances among the \" speech functions \" themselves). \r\nFor fear that I may be misunderstood in my use of the term \"dis- \r\nturbance \" of speech I wish to say that I have no reference here to \r\naphasia. I mean, among other things, by speech disturbance what \r\nthe Freudian means: For example, in the manifest content of dreams \r\none finds new words, misplacement of words, condensation of words, \r\netc.; and in the association test the failure of words and an increased \r\nreaction time between stimulus word and response. These are speech \r\ndisturbances and hence habit disturbaxnces, exactly on a par with the \r\nparalysis of arm or leg in hysteria, defensive reactions, compensatory \r\nreactions, and the like. All such disturbances of habit-superfluous \r\nand useless conditioned reflexes-may be found to date back to some \r\nprimary stimulus (possibly to sex trauma, exposure,3 masturbation, \r\n3 I believe it takes more than a single shock or disturbance to bring such \r\nconditional reflexes in its train. Usually I believe it is a long-continued struggle \r\nwith environment which brings them. \r\nThis content downloaded from 194.29.185.203 on Sat, 24 May 2014 16:01:47 PM\r\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:31:22.208Z","citation":"","pageIndex":4,"uniqueId":"WatBehavior16","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[WatBehavior16]] WatsonJ - 1916 - Behavior and the Concept of Mental Disease.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[WatBehavior16]] WatsonJ - 1916 - Behavior and the Concept of Mental Disease.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:31:22.216Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:22.208Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"8a0c2483-6041-422a-bb1f-cc5e6aa65224","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T02:53:34.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:22.180Z","text":"well as begun in behavior terms. \r\nI think the chief difficulty in completing the description in terms \r\nof the every-day languauge of habit formation lies in our failure to \r\n","title":"Thesis.

But whether they are \"good\" or \r\n\"bad\" they must give way as we put on the habits required of adults. \r\nSome of them yield with difficulty and we often get badly twisted in \r\nattempting to put them away, as every psychiatric clinic can testify.' \r\nI then try to show that such habit systems need never have been \r\n\"conscious\" (and here all I mean by being \"conscious\" -and all I \r\nbelieve the psychopathologists mean by it-is that the patient can not \r\nphrase in terms of words the habit twists which have become a part \r\nof his biological equipment). The implication is clear that in the \r\npsychoneuroses I should look for habit disturbances-maladjust- \r\nments-and should attempt to describe my findings in terms of the \r\ninadequacy of responses, of wrong responses, and of the complete \r\nlack of responses to the objects and situations in the daily life of the \r\npatient. I should likewise attempt to trace out the original con- \r\nditions leading to maladjustment and the causes leading to its con- \r\ntinuation. To these statements most psychopathologists will sub- \r\nscribe, but most of them will insist that maladjustments can not be \r\nstated wholly in behavior terms. It is just here that I think my \r\ndifficulty in understanding the psychiatrist's position begins. I be- \r\nlieve that the description of \"mental\" cases can be completed as \r\nwell as begun in behavior terms. \r\nI think the chief difficulty in completing the description in terms \r\nof the every-day languauge of habit formation lies in our failure to \r\nlook upon language (the patient's here) as being only a system of \r\nmotor habits. As a short cut-a system of economy-the human \r\nanimal has formed a system of language habits (spoken words, \r\ninner speech, etc.). These language habits are built up from and \r\nalways correspond more or less closely to the general system of \r\nbodily habits (I contrast here for convenience of expression lan- \r\nguage habits and bodily habits) such as the eye-hand, ear-hand, etc., \r\nsystems of coordination and their complex integrations. This gen- \r\neral correspondence between language and bodily habits is shown \r\nclearly in the football field, where we see the player making a com- \r\nplex series of movements and later hear him stating in words what \r\nsvstems of plays he employed; and in the case where we hear a man \r\ntell us what acts he is going to perform on a horizontal bar and later \r\nsee him executing these acts. Words have grown up around motor \r\nacts and have no functional significance apart from their connection \r\nwith motor acts. I have come recently to the view that speech should \r\nbe looked upon as a vast system of conditioned reflexes. In a pre- \r\nvious paper2 I sketched the method of establishing motor and secre- \r\ntory conditioned reflexes.

JENNINGS. Pub. by the Carnegie Institution of\r\nWashington, 1904. Pp. 256.\r\nProfessor Jennings in this volume takes his stand against a strict\r\ninterpretation of the theory of tropisms. The author studies in de-\r\ntail : (1) ' The Reactions of Heat and Cold in the Ciliate Infusoria,'\r\n(2) ' Reactions to Light in Ciliates and Flagellates,' and (3) ' Re-\r\nactions to Stimuli in Certain Rotifera (Metazoa).' With the data thus\r\nobtained (using in addition the results of his many former studies) he\r\ncritically discusses the essential features of the theory of tropisms\r\n(paper 4) .\r\nThe two fundamental assumptions of this theory are: (1) \" T h e\r\nmovements of organisms toward certain regions and their avoidance\r\nof others are due to orientation; i. e., to a certain position which the\r\norganism is forced by the external stimulus to take, and which leads\r\nthe organism toward (or away from) the source of the stimulus with-\r\nout any will or desire of the organism, * * * . (2) \" The external\r\nagent by which the movement is controlled produces its characteristic\r\neffect directly on that part of the body upon which it impinges.\"\r\nProfessor Jennings shows that orientation is not a primary or\r\nstriking factor in the reactions of the organisms studied above, to\r\nmechanical stimuli, to chemicals, to heat and cold and to variations\r\nin osmotic pressure. \" T h e response in all these cases is produced\r\nthrough a ' motor reflex,' consisting usually of a movement backward,\r\nfollowed by a turning toward a structurally defined side. The di-\r\nrection of turning is thus determined by internal factors.\"\r\nWhile orientation is a striking feature in the reactions of these\r\norganisms to stimulation by light, the method of orientation is, never-\r\ntheless, incompatible with the idea that it is due to the direct action of\r\nthe stimulus upon the motor organs of the part of the body on which\r\nthe light impinges. Orientation occurs by turning toward a certain\r\nstructurally defined side, without regard to the part of the body struck\r\nby the light.\r\nThe reaction method of the rotifera to the electric current is a\r\n' motor reflex ' and hence inconsistent with the tropism schema. In\r\nthe reactions of infusoria to this stimulus there is only a partial agree-\r\nment with the requirements of the theory. Professor Jennings is in-\r\nclined to rule out reactions to the electric current, since it appears to\r\nproduce results of a peculiar kind which are not comparable to those\r\nproduced by other methods of stimulation.\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:31:25.545Z","citation":"","pageIndex":0,"uniqueId":"WatReview05","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[WatReview05]] WatsonJ - 1905 - Review of Contributions to the Study of the Behavior of Lower Organisms.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[WatReview05]] WatsonJ - 1905 - Review of Contributions to the Study of the Behavior of Lower Organisms.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:31:25.588Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:25.545Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"f5a64d66-e8d5-4bbc-ae1d-ff07316a5f6a","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T00:19:45.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:25.800Z","text":"Again, Loeb presents in his writings numerous instances analogous to\r\nthe above.

But inasmuch as Loeb in all\r\nhis papers is constantly attacking the psychologist, whom he calls the\r\nmetaphysician (he has not yet learned to make the distinction between\r\nmodern psychology and modern metaphysics),1 and since his writings\r\nare read widely by biologists, it behooves us for the sake of the young\r\nbiologist to say a word in our own defense. It is all the more imper-\r\native to do this now, because the relations between the students of\r\ncomparative psychology, and those of biology are becoming closer\r\nand closer. And if peace is to be maintained, there must be a certain\r\nbreadth of mind on both sides, and a certain mutual insight into the\r\nprinciples of each other's science. What is still more important, and\r\nthis is what Loeb especially ignores, each side must recognize\r\nthat the fundamental metaphysical assumptions of the other are dif-\r\nferent; matter, force, energy, etc., on the one hand, mental processes,\r\nsimple and complex on the other. In Loeb's book, he gives us to\r\nunderstand that he will have given an ultimate explanation of life\r\nwhen he shall have ruled out all metaphysical explanations and sub-\r\nstituted ' physico-chemical' ones in their place.\r\nA few sentences which certainly ' do him justice' and which lose\r\nnothing of their clearness and cogency by being ' separated from their\r\ncontext,' quoted from the book under review, may serve to show\r\nLoeb's wilful misunderstanding of psychology. \"What do we know\r\nconcerning the nature of these automatic mechanisms ?

As purely descriptive terms they were acceptable but not very \r\nuseful. The word “tropism” could only have real significance if it could be shown that it \r\nrepresented a class of orientations due to totally independent physiological processes oc- \r\ncurring in the two halves of a bilaterally symmetric animal-what Jennings called “the \r\nlocal action tropism theory.”2s It was necessary to explain how the mechanics of the reac- \r\ntion resulted from the particular structure of each species. Galvanotropism was such a \r\n“local action,” but this proved nothing, because galvanotropism was unnatural, a mere \r\nlaboratory artifact. “Local action” tropisms certainly played no role in the behavior of \r\nthe asymmetrical protozoa, from an evolutionary viewpoint the simplest, most fun- \r\ndamental organisms. Differential sensibility was merely a name for many different \r\nphysiological reaction mechanisms; as such it was of little explanatory value.26 \r\nJennings was concerned with describing the natural activities-the adaptations- of \r\nhis animals as accurately as possible. Stimuli to which these simple organisms reacted \r\nappeared only as the result of previous “spontaneous” movements; motion was caused \r\nby specific internal physiological processes. Jennings argued that the behavior of a \r\nparamecium depended upon the totality of its changing physiological state. While very \r\nlittle was known about these states, some things could be stated about them through \r\nobservation of behavior itself. Noxious stimuli tended to produce negative reactions, and \r\nthrough a process of trial and error those conditions most conducive to life were selected. \r\nIn fact, repeated encounters with gradually arising harmful situations would lead to the \r\n“readier resolution of physiological states,” whereby the animal responded not to the \r\nnoxious stimulus but to other stimuli, neutral in themselves, which generally led to the \r\nnoxious stimulus.2’ \r\nSuch a conception depended upon the intimate linkage of experience, physiology, \r\nheredity, and evolution. Since Jennings erroneously believed that conjugation played an \r\ninsignificant role in the life cycle of protozoa, he thought that successful trial and error \r\nreactions to a new situation would gradually (through their readier resolution) move to \r\ndeeper physiological levels, would be maintained in the continuity of the fission chain, \r\nand could thus cause variation in instincts and evolutionary adaptation. A chain of \r\ngenerations of protozoa was essentially a single organism. It accumulated knowledge \r\nwith repeated trial and error experiences and as a result gradually improved its adapta- \r\ntion to the environment. \r\nJennings allied himself most explicitly with the ideas of C. Lloyd Morgan, J. Mark \r\nBaldwin, and L. T. Hobhouse. His linkage of trial and error learning to evolution was an \r\nexemplification of and foundation for Baldwin’s view-adopted from Herbert Spencer \r\nand Alexander Bain-that the ability to learn arose in the early history of life from selec- \r\ntion of random movements by “the organic analogue of the hedonic consciousness.” Jen- \r\nnings shared with Baldwin and Morgan the desire to show that individual learning was a \r\nmajor force in evolutionary progress even if, as seemed increasingly likely, the neo- \r\nLamarckian belief in the direct inheritance of acquired habits were untrue.” \r\nJennings’s book prompted responses from Loeb (then at Berkeley), H. B. Torrey (an \r\nassistant professor there), and G. H. Parker of Harvard. Loeb restricted himself to point- \r\ning out that the inapplicability of the tropism concept to asymmetrical paramecia was \r\nirrelevant to its use in other cases.28 Parker’s objections were similar. He felt that Jen- \r\nnings had raised a straw man with the demand that tropistic responses be traced to in- \r\ndependent physiological processes in the two body halves. It was a fact that there were \r\nmany orientations to stimuli which were the direct result of different levels of stimulation \r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:31:39.296Z","citation":"","pageIndex":5,"uniqueId":"PauLoeb-Jennings81","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[PauLoeb-Jennings81]] PaulyP - 1981 - The Loeb-Jennings debate and the science of animal behavior.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[PauLoeb-Jennings81]] PaulyP - 1981 - The Loeb-Jennings debate and the science of animal behavior.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:31:39.411Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:39.296Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"eefa503a-ec8b-4e74-9e77-5a26f3bf8616","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-11T20:58:08.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:34.125Z","text":"These processes, by which behavior becomes more or less enduringly\r\nmodified, are known to play a large part in the behavior of higher inver-\r\ntebrates, such as ants and bees, and in the vertebrates.

Where such modifiability exists, the definite\r\n\"\r\nreflex\"\r\nis not to be considered a permanent, final element of behavior. On the\r\ncontrary, it is something developed, and it must differ in individuals\r\nwith different histories.

The power of changing when acted upon by\r\nouter agents, in such a way as to react differently thereafter, is one of the\r\nmost important properties of living matter, and it is misleading to ignore\r\nthis property and deal with animals as if their reactions were invariable.\r\nHow the modifications occur is one of the fundamental problems of\r\nphysiology. We must remember that even what we call memory, in-\r\ntelligence, and reasoning are composed objectively of certain physio-\r\nlogical processes. In other words, as Liebmann has emphasized, there\r\nare objective material processes that follow the laws of intelligence, of\r\nreasoning, of logic. This is a capital fact. In searching for the laws of\r\nlife processes we must remember that those just mentioned are as real as\r\nany others, and their laws must be provided for in the physics and\r\nchemistry of colloids if these are to give us the laws of life processes.\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:31:34.092Z","citation":"","pageIndex":277,"uniqueId":"JenBehavior06","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[JenBehavior06]] JenningsH - 1906 - Behavior of the lower organisms.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[JenBehavior06]] JenningsH - 1906 - Behavior of the lower organisms.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:31:34.288Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:34.092Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"41e3367d-9700-449f-aec8-6f72693a2c39","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-11T20:42:50.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:31:48.073Z","text":"Jacques Loeb, M.D.\r\nProfessor of Physiology in the University of Chicago\r\n","title":"Crucial influence for radical behaviorists such as","importance":0,"tags":[{"id":"46aeaa28-e77f-4765-9925-d0c36095d909","extra":"","key":"summary","value":null,"note":null,"cards":[{}]}],"comments":[{"id":"04283703-8f62-4759-9f16-0672ed5a898b","extra":"","text":"Crucial influence for radical behaviorists such as Watson.

Watson's understanding of evolution is well known. Citing Jennings \r\n(1906) in support of his views, Watson (1914) concluded: \r\nNo new principle is needed in passing from the unicellular to man. As we pass from \r\nthe responses of the simple organisms to the more complex one of the higher \r\nanimals we find (I) a greater number of units, and (2) more complex forms of \r\ncombinations of these units.

The first understanding, that of Romanes and Morgan appears to have \r\nbeen working toward that end.

He even advanced \r\nthe idea that what people called conscious or psychic, though it did not exist as \r\nsuch, did exist as associative memory, which was the unique product of in­\r\ncreased complexity of the nervous system in higher animals. This hypothesis was \r\nfurther reinforced with a theory of discontinuous emergence similar to that of \r\nMorgan (Loeb, 1900, p. 252). \r\nOn the other hand, however, Loeb was not a Darwinist and was generally \r\nskeptical, if not overtly contemptuous, of the evolutional speculations of his \r\ncontemporaries. In his 1916 book, The Organism as a Whole, he devoted a \r\nsingle chapter of less than three pages to the topic of evolution. His message was \r\nsimple: He would believe it when some evolutionist could demonstrate an actual \r\ntransmutation of species-preferably in the laboratory. \r\nEven Loeb's concession to emergence soon broke down. Loeb (1900) stated: \r\nWe, of course, concede that the associative memory shows different degrees of \r\ndevelopment or perfection in different animals. These different degrees are mainly \r\ndifferences in capacity and resonance. By difference in capacity I mean a difference \r\nin the number of associations of which the brain is capable. By difference in the \r\nresonance I mean the ease with which associations are produced. (pp. 253-254) \r\nQuality here was reduced to quantity, a manifestation of the intellectual \r\ntendency of Loeb's that so clearly distinguished him from Darwin, Romanes, \r\nand particularly Morgan. This tendency was reductionism. The psychic was first \r\nreduced to association, but only to make it accessible to a more fundamental \r\nanalysis: \"We consider it our aim to work out the dynamics of the processes of \r\nassociation, and find out the physical or chemical conditions which determine the \r\nvariation in the capacity of memory in the various organisms\" (Loeb, 1900, p. \r\n287). \r\nLoeb could not have been anywhere near as disappointed at Herbert Jenning's \r\ndiscovery of associative processes in the most primitive organisms (Jennings, \r\n1906) as Robert Yerkes suggested in 1905. \r\nThe reductionist trend continued with Edward Thorndike. He described his \r\ncomparative psychological task as follows (Thorndike, 1911): \r\nIf we could prove that what we call ideational life and reasoning were not new and \r\nunexplainable species of intellectual life but only the natural consequences of an \r\nincrease in the number, delicacy, and complexity of associations of the general \r\nanimal sort, we should have made out an evolution of mind comparable to the \r\nevolution of living forms. (p. 286) \r\nThis reductively quantitative view of development, Thorndike (l9ll) felt, \r\nwas born out by the existing evidence of his time.

With respect to mental evolution, Darwin appears not to have been a \r\nDarwinian. His views on this were most like those reductionists who pronounced \r\nthemselves anti-Darwinian, and most unlike those who were called correctly, I \r\nbelieve, Darwinians. \r\nTo these conclusions, I add the following observations: \r\nl. The Thorndike-Watson style of reductionist continuity theory appears to \r\nhave become hegemonic in 20th century comparative psychology. \r\n2. This hegemony successfully absorbed whatever opposition might have \r\ncome from the functionalists and it has resisted any inroads from antireduc­\r\ntionists such as T. C. Schneirla. \r\n3. The result of this hegemony has been a de-emphasis on evolution in \r\ncomparative psychology, with the development of a consequent vulnerability to \r\nreductionist attacks from the ethologists and particularly from sociobiology. \r\n4. I suggest that it is time for comparative psychologists to reexamine their \r\ncommitment to evolutionary principles and, once again, lend serious attention to \r\nthe questions of mental evolution with a view to strengthening the philosophical \r\nand theoretical basis for their scientific efforts. \r\nREFERENCES \r\nCarter, M.

Small, Fellow in Psychology, Clark University.\r\nA study of the psychic development of any young animal\r\nneeds no apology. Apart from the fascination and the self¬\r\neducation of watching the development of any form of life from\r\nits early protoplasmic simplicity into complex maturity, there\r\nis the solid scientific reason that Genetic Psychology has much\r\nto hope from minute and accurate records of the developmental\r\nperiods of young animals of all species. It may never be possi¬\r\nble to reconstruct a complete psychic organism from the evidence\r\nof a single trait—an ideal borrowed from morphology—but\r\nsomething surely may be accomplished towards a comparative\r\nembryology of the soul. What Preyer and others have done\r\nfor the human infant, needs to be done also for the baby-animal\r\nof every species. Prof. Wesley Mills, of Montreal, has already\r\ndone this for the dog, cat, rabbit, guinea-pig and chick—which\r\nlatter has also received careful study from Spalding, Morgan,\r\nThorndike, Kline and others.\r\nThe present form of this study was suggested to me by Prof.\r\nMills’s very interesting and attractive work. I have adopted\r\nhis method of giving the diary of the first few weeks of the\r\nyoung animal’s life, substantially as the notes were jotted down,\r\nfollowing this with a general summary of results and some in\r\nferences as to the significance of special features. For this\r\npurpose one litter of five rats was carefully observed daily, from\r\nbirth to the age of four weeks. For study of special points\r\nand confirmatory evidence other litters were often used.\r\nFrom a physiological point of view the developmental period\r\nof the human organism1 falls into two great divisions—before\r\nand after puberty—the ante and post urbem conditam of growth.\r\nThe pre-pubertal period is childhood. But this again is divided,\r\nupon physiological and anatomical grounds, into two periods,\r\ninfancy (das eigentliche Kindesalter, infantia, enfance) and\r\nchildhood proper (das Knabenalter, pueritia, jeunesse). With¬\r\nout pausing for the anatomical characters upon which this\r\ndivision is based, it is perhaps a fair statement to say that\r\ninfancy is the period in the child’s life before the neuro-mus-\r\n1Vierordt: Gerhardt’s Lehrbuch der Kinderkrankheiten, B.

Furthermore, some-\r\nthing must already be at an appropriate stage for certain possibilities to be open to it. \r\nApplied to mental evolution, this entails that evolution had to proceed in progressive \r\nstages, and for Morgan this is usually reflex, instinct, intelligence, and then, finally, \r\nreason.49 There need not be the germ of the next stage in the prior stage, but only \r\nthe relevant sort of potential.50 This results in a system very similar to Spencer’s, but \r\none without the emphasis on continuity, given that the higher will contain the lower, \r\nbut the lower need not have some part of the higher. For Morgan, there can be true \r\ndiscontinuities, but there cannot be skipped steps. Regarding the role of discontinu-\r\nity in Morgan, while I do not follow this lead here, it is possible Morgan felt more \r\ncomfortable eschewing absolute continuity distanced from the religious debates \r\nso often involved in early evolutionary discussions of the human mind. However, \r\ndespite this difference, Morgan retains a very similar series of linear developments \r\nas the animal mind moves from a series of automatically triggered actions, which \r\ncan occur separately or together, to these actions occurring together, and to the mod-\r\nification and control of these actions by consciousness. This Spencerian structure is \r\nultimately crucial to his intended reforms.\r\nHowever, to be clear, while Spencer was an especially notable influence on \r\nMorgan, and the most prominent advocate of the linear progressive understand-\r\nings of mental evolution, he hardly had a monopoly on the idea.51 Romanes, too, \r\nfor example, adopted an extremely vertical understanding of mental evolution, writ-\r\ning “throughout the brute creation, from wholly unintelligent animals to highly \r\nintelligent, we can trace one continues gradation” (1884a, b, c, d, e, p. 8). Overall, \r\nRomanes’s approach is quite different from Morgan’s, as he used a far finer series \r\nof distinctions and attempted to organize the animal kingdom with respect to some \r\n28 (if the chart at the beginning of his Mental Evolution is to be believed) different \r\nstages (Romanes and Darwin 1884). But Romanes nonetheless serves as an impor-\r\ntant reminder. Linear, hierarchical thinking was not some idle leftover of a pre-Dar-\r\nwin age, but a central feature of early comparative psychology,52 baked in by such \r\nfoundational figures as Spencer, Romanes, and Morgan. Morgan, in fact, above all, \r\n48 And, correspondingly, “infra-consciousness,” the “mental” that corresponded to simple matter within \r\nMorgan’s monistic framing. This approach was almost certainly derived from the “mind-stuff” thesis of \r\nClifford (1878).\r\n49 For more on Morgan’s hierarchy, see Clatterbuck (2016).\r\n50 For discussion of the role of discontinuity in Morgan’s thinking about animal psychology, see Allen-\r\nHermanson (2005) and Clatterbuck (2016).\r\n51 See Ruse (2009).\r\n52 For an analysis of the pervasiveness of such thinking, see Hodos and Campbell (1969).\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.904Z","citation":"","pageIndex":19,"uniqueId":"ArnConwy19","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ArnConwy19]] ArnetE - 2019 - Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Methodology, and the Origins of Comparative Psychology.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[ArnConwy19]] ArnetE - 2019 - Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Methodology, and the Origins of Comparative Psychology.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:08.145Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.904Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"8cc893c1-b261-40ef-ab4f-c4495a861e97","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-10T13:59:46.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.843Z","text":"eflex action.

By composing instincts out of reflex actions, Spencer’s \r\ntheory necessitated that the evolution of intelligence must move in that order (p. \r\n550). As instincts get increasingly complicated and the challenge of coordinating \r\nthe component reflexes more severe—that is, as these clusters of actions cease to be \r\nfully automatic—memory and concordantly consciousness are needed to maintain \r\nthem (p. 562). The next step after instinct is reason, and he contended that there \r\nis in fact no clear boundary between instinct and reason, but that reasoning is sim-\r\nply what happens when instinct ascends into relations that are especially complex \r\nor abstract (p. 564). Complexity, consciousness, and intelligence all move together \r\nfor Spencer, given that an increasingly sophisticated and powerful consciousness is \r\nneeded to control a more complicated jumble of reflexes and instincts. Spencer’s \r\naccount has several features worth attending to: It is hierarchical; it is linear; it is \r\ncompositional, such that each stage is composed out of the elements of the prior \r\nstage; and it is continuous.\r\nMorgan’s understanding of mental evolution shares much with Spencer’s. In his \r\nIntroduction to Comparative Psychology, he does not dwell much on reflex, perhaps \r\ndue to concentrating his attention on vertebrates, but he does clarify that a “reflex \r\naction” is “that which is performed through the instrumentality of the mechanism \r\nfor automatic co-ordination” (1894a, p. 185). Automaticity is the hallmark of reflex \r\naction for Morgan; like Spencer, he sees it as a behavior that does not require media-\r\ntion via the mind or consciousness. However, again like Spencer, in higher organ-\r\nisms these behaviors can be controlled by consciousness with an associated coor-\r\ndinating center (Morgan 1894a, p. 194). Regarding instinct, Morgan has perfect \r\nand imperfect versions. A perfect instinct is a fully automatic behavior that requires \r\nno guidance by learning, and therefore seems to be quite close to reflex actions for \r\nMorgan. An imperfect instinct is one that is subject to refinement via intelligence, \r\nwhich is a word of art for Morgan and refers to the modification of behavior to sur-\r\nrounding conditions based on associated experience (Morgan 1894a, p. 207).43 By \r\nhis 1896 work Habit and Instinct, Morgan no longer pushes the perfect/imperfect \r\ndistinction and explicitly identifies with Spencer’s account of instinct as a compound \r\nreflex action. Morgan does, however, have a somewhat different account of reason. \r\nHe believes that reasoning involves the perception of relations as such. For example, \r\nthe connection between dropping a glass and the glass shattering–that the glass shat-\r\nters because it is dropped, rather than the mere fact of co-occurrence, he restricts \r\nto humans alone (Morgan 1894a, p. 237). Generally, emphasizing discontinuity \r\n43 For Morgan, intelligence operates via associative learning; see especially (1894a, p. 215).\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.526Z","citation":"","pageIndex":17,"uniqueId":"ArnConwy19","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ArnConwy19]] ArnetE - 2019 - Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Methodology, and the Origins of Comparative Psychology.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[ArnConwy19]] ArnetE - 2019 - Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Methodology, and the Origins of Comparative Psychology.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.843Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.526Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"370aa772-892c-4272-9543-097789a1913c","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-10T13:52:31.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.374Z","text":"ords ‘higher’ and ‘lower’” in his copy of Robert Chambers’s Vestiges of the Natu-\r\nal History of Creation (see Gregorio and Gill 1990, p. 164).

Morgan, in stark con-\r\ntrast, built the words higher and lower right into his famous canon of interpretation. \r\nIn this, he stands with Spencer.\r\nHerbert Spencer has become notorious for his progressive and hierarchical con-\r\nception of evolution, and early historiography boxed him into the morally suspect \r\n“Social Darwinist” camp (Hofstadter 1992), but his own views are considerably \r\nmore sophisticated.40 Far from advocating a simplistic, linear Great Chain of Being- \r\nstyle ordering,41 Spencer’s notion of progress borrows extensively from the embry-\r\nological research of Karl Ernst von Baer and interpreted progress as a process of \r\ndiversification and specialization rather than merely change in a single clear direc-\r\ntion (Smith 1982). Progress moves, as Spencer puts it, from the homogeneous to the \r\nheterogeneous, and this helped to explain the astounding diversity of life (Spencer \r\n1857).\r\nBut Spencer had a highly generalized understanding of intelligence (Herbert \r\nSpencer 1855, pp. 491–505), such that there was no diversification into different \r\nkinds of intelligence. Intelligence for Spencer is the adjustment of inner relations \r\n(mental aspects), to outer relations (the world). He argued:\r\nThis continued process of differentiation and integration—by which the \r\nchanges forming the substance of psychical life, are first gradually concen-\r\ntrated upon the surface of the organism; afterward upon certain regions of \r\nthat surface, afterwards upon those most specialized parts of it constituting \r\nthe organs of the higher sense; and in the most perfect of these are even more \r\nor less localized in minute centres; will clearly show how the psychical life \r\ngrows distinct from the physical life, by the increasing tendency of its changes \r\nto assume the serial arrangement [only one state of consciousness at a time]. \r\nWe have nothing to do with the progressive development of the nervous sys-\r\ntem, and the actions that are carried on through its masses. All these actions \r\noriginate in the senses. The internal changes are consequent upon the external. \r\nAnd just in proportion as the external ones tend towards the serial form, the \r\nconsequent internal ones must do the same. Evidently, then, this distinction is \r\ninvolved in the very progress of the sensitive organization. (Spencer 1855, pp. \r\n499–500)\r\nWhat this means is that the diversification, specialization, and localization of the \r\nsenses, which Spencer associated with progress across the animal kingdom, can be \r\npaired with a generally universal understanding of intelligence.42 In his Principles \r\n40 For a more nuanced account of Spencer, see Offer (2010), Smith (1982), and Weinstein (2017).\r\n41 The \"Great Chain of Being” refers to a complete hierarchical ordering of all animals; the best-known \r\nwork on it, even if now a bit outdated, is Lovejoy (1976 (originally 1936)).\r\n42 Technically, even accepting Spencer’s claim that diverse organisms must encounter the same chal-\r\nlenge of integrating sensory experience, one need not accept that they do it in the same way, i.e. one need \r\nnot accept that organisms think in a similar way. I cannot find a specific response to this concern in Spen-\r\ncer, but he is clearly comfortable making the assumption. I suspect such worries are far more the product \r\nof us now trying to shake off our Spencerian (and early hierarchical) heritage than anything Spencer \r\nhimself would have needed to deal with.\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.344Z","citation":"","pageIndex":16,"uniqueId":"ArnConwy19","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ArnConwy19]] ArnetE - 2019 - Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Methodology, and the Origins of Comparative Psychology.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[ArnConwy19]] ArnetE - 2019 - Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Methodology, and the Origins of Comparative Psychology.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.460Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.344Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"bfee6f5e-5f6f-48aa-ad29-0a1d93e65fe8","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-10T13:52:11.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:07.280Z","text":"volution of the mind across animals.

There is, however, nary a whisper of such engagement in any of the works \r\nof Morgan on comparative psychology. It is likely that Morgan sought to partici-\r\npate within the larger turn towards naturalism that was sweeping British professional \r\nscience at the time (Turner 1978). The concerns of clerics, evidently, were just as \r\nunwelcome as the cute anecdotes of casual observers.\r\nHerbert Spencer and Morgan’s Comparative Psychology\r\nOf those influences that shaped Morgan’s comparative psychology, few, if any, are as \r\npowerful as Herbert Spencer, a leading philosopher and evolutionary thinker of the \r\ntime. Unlike Darwin, Spencer’s sprawling synthetic philosophy attempted to explain \r\neverything from chemistry to culture within an evolutionary framework, rather than \r\njust life. Morgan made no secret of his intellectual debt to Herbert Spencer, forth-\r\nrightly stating in a letter to Spencer, “to none of my intellectual masters do I owe a \r\nlarger debt of gratitude than to you.”28 He mentioned Spencer as an important influ-\r\nence in an autobiographical essay (Morgan 1932), he delivered the 1913 Herbert \r\nSpencer Lecture on Spencer’s philosophy of science (Morgan 1914), and Spencer \r\nwas one of a handful of scientists thanked in the preface to Morgan’s Introduction to \r\nComparative Psychology (1894a, b). Moreover, one of Morgan’s first major works \r\nwas the 1885 Springs of Conduct: An Essay in Evolution, where he explained every-\r\nthing from physics to the human mind on the basis of evolution, marking his inher-\r\nitance of the pervasively evolutionary approach to everything that was the touch-\r\nstone of Spencer’s synthetic philosophy. However, Spencer’s importance to Morgan \r\nextended well beyond general evolutionary philosophy.\r\nSpencer was greatly interested in the workings of the mind and was a leading \r\nfigure in British psychology, helping to characterize the organization and interests \r\nof the young field (Smith 1982). His impact is especially striking in Morgan’s early \r\nwork. Morgan’s initial definitions of key concepts like reflex, instinct, and intelli-\r\ngence are all heavily indebted to Spencer (reflex and intelligence in particular are \r\nall but identical) (Spencer 1855). Morgan’s analysis of the perception of relations, \r\nwhich forms a substantial part of his Introduction to Comparative Psychology, is \r\nexplicitly traced to Spencer (Morgan 1894a, p. x). Additionally, like other early phil-\r\nosophical psychologists, Spencer was concerned with what was required to make the \r\nstudy of mind scientific. Fundamental to this endeavor for him was connecting the \r\ndata gained from introspection with data about the external world.

He is especially well \r\nknown for his eponymous canon, which aimed to provide a rule for the interpreta-\r\ntion of mind from behavior. Emphasizing the importance of the context in which \r\nMorgan was working—one in which casual observations of animal behavior could \r\nbe found in Nature magazine every week and psychology itself was fighting for sci-\r\nentific legitimacy—I provide an account of Morgan’s vision for the comparative \r\npsychologist qua professional psychologist. To this end, I explore the important con-\r\nnection between Morgan and the evolutionary theorist, philosopher, and psycholo-\r\ngist Herbert Spencer. It is from Spencer, I contend, that Morgan inherited a number \r\nof his key epistemological and methodological concerns about the nascent science \r\nof comparative psychology. This extends all the way to the canon, which only works \r\nas intended when paired with a Spencerian understanding of mental evolution as a \r\nprogressive linear sequence. Far from being an incidental residue of a pre-Darwin-\r\nian time, hierarchy was intentionally built into the very core of Morgan’s scientific \r\ncomparative psychology.\r\nKeywords Morgan’s canon · Spencer · Weismann · Comparative psychology\r\nIntroduction\r\nConwy Lloyd Morgan was a British geologist, psychologist, biologist, philoso-\r\npher, and comparative psychologist who is largely famous for a single sentence: \r\nhis “canon” of interpretation. Initially presented in a lecture by Lloyd Morgan in \r\nEngland in 1892 (see the report by Dixon 1892), the canon achieved wide circula-\r\ntion after its publication in Morgan’s Introduction to Comparative Psychology.

Morgan’s new psychological expertise is on full display in his sweeping Ani-\r\nmal Life and Intelligence (1890), which combined his growing interest in the con-\r\ncrete details of psychology with his philosophical and zoological background. It is \r\narguably his first major contribution to comparative psychology.27 It is a hard claim \r\nto test, but I would hypothesize one of the major factors softening Morgan’s stance \r\nagainst comparative psychology was that he was becoming more familiar with the \r\npracticalities of contemporary psychology, such that the scorched-earth arguments \r\nof philosophical outsiders no longer seemed so inescapable.\r\nBy 1894, when Morgan published Introduction to Comparative Psychology, he \r\nmakes it abundantly clear that the comparative psychologist must be a psycholo-\r\ngist, rather than merely someone who observes animals. A decade earlier, this would \r\nhave excluded him as well. In the Introduction Morgan writes:\r\nIt must not be forgotten that introspective psychology is an essential prelimi-\r\nnary to comparative psychology, and that, if it is to produce results of scientific \r\nvalue, it must be based upon exact and oft-repeated observation. Such obser-\r\nvation, however, requires special training, not less than in objective observa-\r\ntion in physics or in biology. It would be an inestimable boon to comparative \r\npsychology if all those who venture to discuss the problems with which this \r\nscience deals would submit to some preparatory discipline in the methods and \r\nresults of introspective observation. (1894a, p. xii)\r\nMorgan’s emphasis on psychological training is a stark departure from the natural his-\r\ntory approaches of Romanes and Darwin before him. Darwin and Romanes served as \r\nhubs for sprawling networks of observers, collating and clarifying the contributions of \r\nhundreds of casual animal watchers. Morgan is far more exclusionary, demanding that \r\nthe work of only certain kinds of observers be considered as evidence. More precise \r\nintrospection would not resolve all the difficulties described above, but it would help \r\nto mediate against the problem of all investigators having to explore the minds of ani-\r\nmals through the understanding of their own mind. Morgan’s demand also demarcated \r\na clear professional class for comparative psychology. In an autobiographical essay, \r\nMorgan is completely frank that he saw a professional, and not merely scientific, \r\nopportunity in studying mental evolution (Morgan 1932). This was a correct assump-\r\ntion on his part: he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1899 specifically for \r\nwork in psychology (Wilson 2002). If there were any doubt that Morgan considered \r\nhimself a professional psychologist generally, rather than specifically a comparative \r\npsychologist, he published a general psychology textbook for teachers at the same time \r\nas his Introduction to Comparative Psychology (Morgan 1894b).\r\nOne more thing should be briefly noted concerning Morgan’s ambitions for a \r\nprofessional comparative psychology, which is made remarkable by its absence, not \r\npresence–religion. Previous interlocutors about the relationship between the mind \r\n27 This view of Animal Life and Intelligence is echoed by Boakes (1984).\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:32:06.543Z","citation":"","pageIndex":10,"uniqueId":"ArnConwy19","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[ArnConwy19]] ArnetE - 2019 - Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Methodology, and the Origins of Comparative Psychology.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[ArnConwy19]] ArnetE - 2019 - Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Methodology, and the Origins of Comparative Psychology.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:32:06.562Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:06.543Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"dd1ef2e1-88d4-4891-bec7-728dfe01278f","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-10T07:28:37.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:32:11.475Z","text":"xtent this further synthesis.

And if it be a symbol of\r\nsome kind, must it not be a symbol that stands for strange\r\nman in general, since there is nothing to suggest any\r\nparticular strange man? But if this be so, and if a\r\ngeneral conception is one which stands not for a particular\r\nobject, but for a group of objects, I do not sec how we\r\ncan deny general conceptions, in this sense of the word,\r\nto our four-footed friends. And if the word abstract idea\r\nstand, as it is sometimes made to do, for general concep¬\r\ntion, we must admit, I think, that such abstract ideas are\r\npossible for the brute.\r\nWe come now to such abstract ideas as result from the\r\nprocess I termed isolation. Are these, too, possible for\r\nthe brute ? I have only to say that it has always seemed\r\nto me that when we speak of being able to form abstract\r\nideas of redness, emptiness, justice, and the like, all we\r\ncan possibly mean is that we can make use of the ।\r\n•words as symbols in a train of thought I have I\r\nonly to say this to indicate the nature of my answer\r\nto this question, I believe such abstract ideas to be\r\nimpossible for the brute, I believe them to be the\r\noutcome of the use of language We see a plum, and\r\nwe find that it is round, and blue, and resisting. From\r\nthese words we form abstract nouns, roundness, blueness,\r\nresistance. We then proceed to manufacture a something\r\nto which each of these words may answer,and we call that\r\nsomething a quality. Having thus made the quality, the\r\nnext thing we do is to try and endow it with a separate '\r\nexistence, and to the results of our endeavours we give ;\r\nthe name abstract idea. All this is a process which grows\r\nout of our use of words under the influence of a developed\r\npower of reflection ; it is an attempt to conceive a reality¬\r\nin-thought answering to certain of our symbols. Without\r\na considerably developed use of symbols such a process is\r\nimpossible. Hence 1 believe that no animal can form an\r\nabstract idea in this sense of the term. He does not pos¬\r\nsess the only possible means of doing so. To form such\r\nabstract ideas as these, is certainly “an excellency which\r\nthe faculties of brutes do by no means attain to.” Here we\r\nmay agree with Locke and his followers.\r\nMay we say, then, that the power of forming abstract\r\nideas, in this sense, is that which distinguishes the intelli¬\r\ngence of man from the intelligence of the brute ? I think\r\nnot. There areT I believe, among the lower races of man,\r\nwhole tribes which are unable to form abstract ideas.\r\nAbstract ideas are made possible by language, but the use\r\nof language does not necessarily imply the ability to form\r\nabstract ideas. Philologists tell us that there are languages\r\nor dialects in which no abstract words are to be found.\r\nThis, however, is certain, that there is no known savage\r\ntribe which has no language. Man is the one being that\r\ncan make use of spoken signs.\r\nBut it may be said that, although their language differs\r\nfrom ours, animals too have their language, imperfect it is\r\ntrue but still a language of their own, a means of com¬\r\nmunication with their fellows. And this is perfectly true.\r\nIt is true, too, that my dogs can understand my language.\r\nBut all that a dog can communicate to his fellow—all that I\r\ncan communicate to my dog is a sign which he has learnt\r\nto associate with certain feelings or with certain actions to\r\nbe performed. The communication deals, too, with imme¬\r\ndiate feeling or action ; its sphere is the here and the\r\nnow. There can be no doubt that dogs associate with\r\nbarking in certain tones, special emotional states in their\r\ncompanions. In fact it is probable that dogs can in this\r\nway communicate with each other a wide range of states\r\nof feeling. But these states are present states, not states\r\npast or future. They are their own states, not the states\r\nof thinking in pictures—pictures far truer and more beautiful than even they\r\ncould describe in words. All processes of thought, in fact, are carried on by\r\nassociation. And in the chain of association there may be links of all kinds\r\nfurnished by all the senses we possess. All that we can say with regard to\r\nman is that he adds to the natural symbols which form links in this chain of\r\nassociation, certain arbitrary symbols of his own manufacture.\r\nof others. A dog can call his companions’ attention to a\r\nworriable cat, or he may have his attention roused by\r\nmy exclaiming “ cat.” But no dog could tell his com¬\r\npanion of the successful ‘‘worry” he had just enjoyed or\r\nsuggest that they should go out for a “ worry ” to-morrow\r\nmorning. And here we come upon what seems to me\r\nthe fact which raises man so immeasurably above the\r\nlevel of the brute. The brute has to be contented •with\r\nthe experience he inherits or individually acqtares.\r\nMan^ through language spoken or written, proJits by\r\nthe experience of his fellows. Even the most savage\r\ntribe has traditions extending back to the father's\r\nfather (Sproat). And the civilised man—has he not in\r\nhis libraries the recorded results of many centuries of\r\never widening experience and ever deepening thought ?\r\nThus it is that language has made us men. By means\r\nof language and language alone has human thought\r\nbecome possible. This it is which has placed so enor¬\r\nmous a gap between the mind of man and the mind of\r\nthe dog. Through language each human being becomes\r\nthe inheritor of the accumulated thought and experience\r\nof the whole human race. Through language has the\r\nhigher abstract thought become possible.\r\nBut though I look upon the difference between human\r\nintelligence and brute intelligence as very great, I do not\r\nbelieve that there is any one faculty which all men possess\r\nand which no brute possesses. I have already stated my\r\nviews on the subject of abstraction, and to what I have\r\nsaid I have nothing now to add. But concerning the\r\nconverse process of construction or object—forming a few\r\nwords may be said. Let me first explain what 1 mean\r\nby construction. Our conception of an object is the result\r\nof a synthesis of its qualities. But this synthesis is, I\r\nimagine, of two kinds. There is a synthesis by immediate\r\nassociation, and a synthesis by reflection. When a dog\r\nsees before him a soaked dog-biscuit, his conception of\r\nthe object is a synthesis by immediate association. The\r\nsight of the biscuit at once suggests by association a\r\ncertain smell and taste. The object he mentally con¬\r\nstructs is built up of these three, sight, smell, and taste.\r\nAll other properties are rejected or eliminated. Now,\r\nsuppose the dog capable of reflecting thus—the biscuit is\r\nlight enough to carry, soft enough to bite, cool enough\r\nnot to burn my mouth—he would then add to his synthesis\r\nby immediate association, a further synthesis by reflection,\r\nand would construct a more complete object. By the\r\nsynthesis by reflection, in fact, all those qualities are added\r\nwhich are unconsciously eliminated in the immediate\r\nconstruction by association. I do not imagine that brutes\r\nhave sufficient power of reflection to affect to any great\r\nextent this further synthesis. Indeed I imagine that\r\nsavages and young children do not habitually go further\r\nthan the construction by association. The further process\r\nhas been added mainly under the influence of a developed\r\nlanguage. The word groups around itself not only the\r\ncluster of associated ideas which make up the ordinary\r\nunreflecting conception of the object it symbolizes, but\r\nalso all those further ideas which are the result of scientific\r\nstudy. The word is the peg upon which we hang those\r\nabstract qualities which by means of words we have\r\nisolated. C.

Now,\r\nsuppose the dog capable of reflecting thus—the biscuit is\r\nlight enough to carry, soft enough to bite, cool enough\r\nnot to burn my mouth—he would then add to his synthesis\r\nby immediate association, a further synthesis by reflection,\r\nand would construct a more complete object. By the\r\nsynthesis by reflection, in fact, all those qualities are added\r\nwhich are unconsciously eliminated in the immediate\r\nconstruction by association. I do not imagine that brutes\r\nhave sufficient power of reflection to affect to any great\r\nextent this further synthesis. Indeed I imagine that\r\nsavages and young children do not habitually go further\r\nthan the construction by association. The further process\r\nhas been added mainly under the influence of a developed\r\nlanguage. The word groups around itself not only the\r\ncluster of associated ideas which make up the ordinary\r\nunreflecting conception of the object it symbolizes, but\r\nalso all those further ideas which are the result of scientific\r\nstudy. The word is the peg upon which we hang those\r\nabstract qualities which by means of words we have\r\nisolated. C.

To this end, I explore the important con-\r\nnection between Morgan and the evolutionary theorist, philosopher, and psycholo-\r\ngist Herbert Spencer. It is from Spencer, I contend, that Morgan inherited a number \r\nof his key epistemological and methodological concerns about the nascent science \r\nof comparative psychology.

This paper, “Are theories of\r\nlearning necessary?” marked a sea-change in\r\nSkinner's metatheoretical position. It repre¬\r\nsented a move away from the classical be¬\r\nhaviorism of Watson (1913, 1919) toward the\r\nradical behaviorism of post-1925 Watson. In¬\r\nterestingly enough and paradoxically, as I have\r\nargued previously (Amsel, 1982, 1989), the\r\nearlier Watsonian position was the more per¬\r\nmissive one; it was not clearly distinguishable\r\nfrom what came to be known as neobehavior¬\r\nism, which was in fact a return to the early\r\nWatsonian behaviorism that was adopted by\r\nTolman and Hull. It was the later, more\r\ndoctrinaire Watsonian position that was\r\nadopted by Skinner in 1950, and that blos¬\r\nsomed later in the form of the Experimental\r\nAnalysis of Behavior. It is my thesis in this\r\npaper that an analysis of the factors that might\r\nhave operated to harden Skinner's position —\r\nfrom an earlier to a later Watsonian form —\r\nwill illuminate the emergence of the Cognitive\r\nRevolution in psychology.\r\nThe period from 1935 to 1950 was a time of\r\nfierce theoretical debate and experimental\r\nconfrontation between the followers of Tolman\r\nand Hull (actually between Tolman's followers\r\nat Berkeley, and Spence and his students at the\r\nUniversity of Iowa). The intellectual battle\r\nraged on several fronts, but four issues were\r\nput to the experimental test: One issue was:\r\nWhat is learned? — sign-significant (S-S)\r\nrelationships or stimulus-response (S—R) asso¬\r\nciations? The other three issues involved the\r\nquestion: How is it learned? Two of these\r\nissues were debated in the context of discrimi¬\r\nnation learning: Is learning continuous (incre¬\r\nmental) or discontinuous (“insightful\")? Is\r\nlearning specific or relational (the transposi¬\r\ntion issue)? The third of the “how is it\r\nlearned?” issues took the form of the famous\r\nlatent learning experiments: Is reinforcement\r\nnecessary for learning or does an animal form a\r\ncognitive map of its environment (e.g. , a maze)\r\nand respond appropriately once reward is\r\nintroduced? Skinner and his followers played\r\nno part in these exciting, if inconclusive,\r\nexperimental confrontations. This fact may\r\nhelp to explain why his landmark 1938 book\r\nseems to have been overshadowed in its time,\r\nand did not — and does not still, in my opinion\r\nhave the influence that was its due. (Many of\r\nthe younger psychologists, even in the field of\r\nconditioning and learning, have never read this\r\nbook, and some have not even heard of it.) To\r\nan outsider to the Hull-Tolman, Iowa-\r\nBerkeley debates (and particularly, perhaps, to\r\nSkinner at that time) the controversies might\r\nhave seemed more talmudic than scientific.\r\nBy the late 1940s, Skinner was at Indiana, as\r\nwas his student Estes, with whom Skinner had\r\nalready published the paper on the conditioned\r\nemotional response. (By this time Skinner had\r\nalso done the original operant work with the\r\npigeon.) In the late 1940s Estes was developing\r\nhis statistical learning theory, to be published\r\nin a paper (Estes, 1950) which was tremen¬\r\ndously influential in the soon-to-be burgeoning\r\nfield of mathematical psychology. Skinner’s\r\n1950 paper, “Are theories of learning neces¬\r\nsary?\", was evidently a reaction to what he\r\nobviously regarded as these arcane theoretical\r\ndevelopments, particularly as he moved in the\r\ndirection of the more radical Watsonian be¬\r\nhaviorism of 1925. This presaged the “pigeon\r\nlab\" at Harvard, the founding of the journal.\r\nThe Experimental Analysis of Behavior, and\r\nSkinner's carefully and brilliantly constructed\r\nascent to the dominant position he held in\r\nbehavioral psychology until his death 40 years\r\nlater, in August, 1990.\r\nIn my opinion (Amsel, 1989), the radical,\r\natheoretical, and very influential position of\r\nSkinner was the stimulus for the cognitive\r\nrevolution that followed, beginning in the late\r\n1950s.

In this\r\nSketch, Skinner made a not uncommon\r\ndistinction between what he called \"rad-\r\nical behaviorism\" (his own view) and\r\n\"methodological behaviorism\" (see Day,\r\n1983; J. Moore, 1981). Why did Skinner\r\nuse the term radical behaviorism in this\r\nmanner in the Sketch? In response to our\r\ninquiry concerning his early usage of the\r\nterm, Skinner stated, \"I don't believe I\r\ninvented the phrase 'radical behavior-\r\nism.' I think it was in the air at the time\"\r\n(personal communication, January 31,\r\n1985). Clearly, in the early 1930s, the\r\nterm was still current for Watson's views,\r\nand Skinner had, perhaps, come across\r\nit in his contacts with the philosophy and\r\npsychology of the time (see Coleman,\r\n1985, for some of these). Further, Skin-\r\nner's depiction ofradical behaviorism is,\r\nin some respects, in accord with Wat-\r\nson's philosophical views, as is suggested\r\nin the last major section of our paper, as\r\nwell as in what follows.\r\nIn the Sketch, methodological behav-\r\niorism was described as a position that\r\ndistinguishes between the scientifically\r\namenable public and the scientifically\r\nuntreatable private. Many behaviorists\r\nsince Watson, and even some present-\r\nday psychologists who might not call\r\nthemselves behaviorists, could be con-\r\nsidered to be behaviorists ofthis sort (see\r\nBrunswik, 1952, p. 66-67; Day, 1980, p.\r\n241; Leahey, 1984, pp. 131-132; Marx\r\n& Hillix, 1979, p. 160). But, as Skinner\r\nstated in his autobiography, occasionally\r\nquoting from the Sketch, \"I preferred the\r\nposition of radical behaviorism, in which\r\nthe existence of subjective entities is de-\r\nnied. I proposed to regard subjective\r\nterms 'as verbal constructs, as grammat-\r\nical traps into which the human race in\r\nthe development of language has fall-\r\nen'\" (Skinner, 1979, p. 117). This view\r\nof subjective terms is similar to one pre-\r\nsented by Watson in Behaviorism (1930,\r\nP. 10).\r\nThese points in the Sketch are expand-\r\ned in Skinner's 1945 paper, where his first\r\npublished use of radical behaviorism (p.\r\n294) occurs in connection with another\r\ndiscussion of the distinction between\r\nmethodological and radical behaviorism.\r\nAlso reminiscent of topics discussed in\r\nthe Sketch, Skinner (1945) wrote that\r\nearly behaviorism did not fulfill its po-\r\ntential because \"it never finished an ac-\r\nceptable formulation of the 'verbal re-\r\nport.'19' The conception ofbehavior which\r\n9 Both Watson and Skinner acknowledged the po-\r\ntential inaccuracy and unreliability ofverbal reports\r\nin general (Skinner, 1979, p. 119, quoting from the\r\nSketch; J. B. Watson, 1924, p. 42).\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:30:59.514Z","citation":"","pageIndex":6,"uniqueId":"SMHistory87","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[SMHistory87]] SchneiderS, MorrisE - 1987 - A History of the Term Radical Behaviorism - From Watson to Skinner.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[SMHistory87]] SchneiderS, MorrisE - 1987 - A History of the Term Radical Behaviorism - From Watson to Skinner.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:30:59.613Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:59.514Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"786ce044-6837-48e3-89a1-ab67394cd173","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T14:06:14.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:55.947Z","text":"ther study.

SKINNER\r\nand terms appropriate to the events to\r\nbe explained differ from the methods\r\nand terms appropriate to the explaining\r\nevents.\r\nIn a third type of learning theory the\r\nexplanatory events are not directly ob-\r\nserved. The writer's suggestion that the\r\nletters CNS be regarded as representing,\r\nnot the Central Nervous System, but\r\nthe Conceptual Nervous System (2, p.\r\n421), seems to have been taken seri-\r\nously. Many theorists point out that\r\nthey are not talking about the nerv-\r\nous system as an actual structure un-\r\ndergoing physiological or bio-chemical\r\nchanges but only as a system with a\r\ncertain dynamic output. Theories of\r\nthis sort are multiplying fast, and so are\r\nparallel operational versions of mental\r\nevents. A purely behavioral definition\r\nof expectancy has the advantage that\r\nthe problem of mental observation is\r\navoided and with it the problem of how\r\na mental event can cause a physical one.\r\nBut such theories do not go so far as to\r\nassert that the explanatory events are\r\nidentical with the behavioral facts which\r\nthey purport to explain. A statement\r\nabout behavior may support such a\r\ntheory but will never resemble it in\r\nterms or syntax. Postulates are good\r\nexamples. True postulates cannot her\r\ncome facts. Theorems may be deduced\r\nfrom them which, as tentative state-\r\nments about behavior, may or may not\r\nbe confirmed, but theorems are not\r\ntheories in the present sense. Postulates\r\nremain theories until the end.\r\nIt is not the purpose of this paper to\r\nshow that any of these theories cannot\r\nbe put in good scientific order, or that\r\nthe, events to which they refer may not\r\nactually occur or be studied by appro-\r\npriate sciences. It would be foolhardy\r\nto deny the achievements of theories of\r\nthis sort in the history of science. The\r\nquestion of whether they are necessary,\r\nhowever, has other implications and is\r\nworth asking. If the answer is no, then\r\nit may be possible to argue effectively\r\nagainst theory in the field of learning.\r\nA science of behavior must eventually\r\ndeal with behavior in its relation to cer-\r\ntain manipulable variables. Theories—\r\nwhether neural, mental, or conceptual—\r\ntalk about intervening steps in these re-\r\nlationships. But instead of prompting\r\nus to search for and explore relevant\r\nvariables, they frequently have quite\r\nthe opposite effect. When we attribute\r\nbehavior to a neural or mental event,\r\nreal or conceptual, we are likely to for-\r\nget that we still have the task of ac-\r\ncounting for the neural or mental event.\r\nWhen we assert that an animal acts in a\r\ngiven way because it expects to receive\r\nfood, then what began as the task of\r\naccounting for learned behavior becomes\r\nthe task of accounting for expectancy.\r\nThe problem is at least equally complex\r\nand probably more difficult. We are\r\nlikely to close our eyes to.it and to use\r\nthe theory to give us answers in place of\r\nthe answers we might find through fur-\r\nther study. It might be argued that the\r\nprincipal function of learning theory to\r\ndate has been, not to suggest appropri-\r\nate research, but to create a false sense\r\nof security, an unwarranted satisfaction\r\nwith the status quo.\r\nResearch designed with respect to\r\ntheory is also likely to be wasteful.\r\nThat a theory generates research does\r\nnot prove its value unless the research\r\nis valuable. Much useless experimenta-\r\ntion results from theories, and much\r\nenergy and skill are absorbed by them.\r\nMost theories are eventually overthrown,\r\nand the greater part of the associated\r\nresearch is discarded. This could be\r\njustified if it were true that productive\r\nresearch requires a theory, as is, of\r\ncourse, often claimed. It is argued that\r\nresearch would be aimless and disor-\r\nganized without a theory to guide it.\r\nThe view is supported by psychological\r\ntexts that take their cue from the logi-\r\ncians rather than empirical science and\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:30:55.849Z","citation":"","pageIndex":1,"uniqueId":"SkiAre50","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[SkiAre50]] SkinnerB - 1950 - Are theories of learning necessary.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[SkiAre50]] SkinnerB - 1950 - Are theories of learning necessary.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:30:55.947Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:55.849Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"7393e1d6-1a6e-4d70-a9a0-de174a8a38ce","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T14:04:13.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:56.082Z","text":"ally work.

Are they data, or infer-\r\nences from data? \"Learning is improve-\r\nment.\" But improvement in what? And\r\nfrom whose point of view? \"Learning is\r\nrestoration of equilibrium.\" But what\r\n2 Some of the material that follows was ob-\r\ntained in 1941-42 in a cooperative study on\r\nthe behavior of the pigeon in which Keller\r\nBreland, Norman Guttman, and W. K. Estes\r\ncollaborated. Some of it is selected from sub-\r\nsequent, as yet unpublished, work on the pi-\r\ngeon conducted by the author at Indiana Uni-\r\nversity and Harvard University. Limitations\r\nof space make it impossible to report full de-\r\ntails here.\r\nis in equilibrium and how is it put there?\r\n\"Learning is problem solving.\" But what\r\nare the physical dimensions of a problem\r\n—or of a solution? Definitions of this\r\nsort show an unwillingness to take what\r\nappears before the eyes in a learning\r\nexperiment as a basic datum. Particu-\r\nlar observations seem too trivial. An\r\nerror score falls; but we are not ready\r\nto say that this is learning rather than\r\nmerely the result of learning. An or-\r\nganism meets a criterion of ten success-\r\nful trials; but an arbitrary criterion is\r\nat variance with our conception of the\r\ngenerality of the learning process.\r\nThis is where theory steps in. If it\r\nis not the time required to get out of a\r\npuzzle box that changes in learning, but\r\nrather the strength of a bond, or the\r\nconductivity of a neural pathway, or\r\nthe excitatory potential of a habit, then\r\nproblems seem to vanish. Getting out\r\nof a box faster and faster is not learn-\r\ning; it is merely performance. The\r\nlearning goes on somewhere else, in a\r\ndifferent dimensional system. And al-\r\nthough the time required depends upon\r\narbitrary conditions, often varies dis-\r\ncontinuously, and is subject to reversals\r\nof magnitude, we feel sure that the\r\nlearning process itself is continuous, or-\r\nderly, and beyond the accidents of\r\nmeasurement. Nothing could better\r\nillustrate the use of theory as a refuge\r\nfrom the data.\r\nBut we must eventually get back to\r\nan observable datum. If learning is the\r\nprocess we suppose it to be, theri it must\r\nappear so in the situations in which we\r\nstudy it. Even if the basic process be-\r\nlongs to some other dimensional system,\r\nour measures must have relevant and\r\ncomparable properties. But productive\r\nexperimental situations are hard to find,\r\nparticularly if we accept certain plau-\r\nsible restrictions.

That nature is orderly\r\nrather than capricious is an example.\r\nCertain statements are also theories\r\nsimply to the extent that they are not\r\nyet facts. A scientist may guess at the\r\nresult of an experiment before the ex-\r\nperiment is carried out. The prediction\r\nand the later statement of result may\r\nbe composed of the same terms in the\r\nsame syntactic arrangement, the differ-\r\nence being in the degree of confidence.\r\nNo empirical statement is wholly non-'\r\ntheoretical in this sense, because evi-\r\ndence is never complete, nor is any pre-\r\ndiction probably ever made wholly with-\r\nout evidence.

In the science of neuro-\r\nphysiology statements of this sort are\r\nnot necessarily theories in the present\r\nsense. ' But in a science of behavior,\r\nwhere we are concerned with whether or\r\nnot an organism secretes saliva when a\r\nbell rings, or jumps toward a gray tri-\r\nangle, or says bik when a cards reads\r\ntuz, or loves someone who resembles his\r\nmother, all statements about the nerv-\r\nous system are theories in the sense that\r\nthey are not expressed in the same terms\r\nand could not be confirmed with the\r\nsame methods of observation as the\r\nfacts for which they are said to account.\r\nA second type of learning theory is in\r\npractice not far from the physiological,\r\nalthough there is less agreement about\r\nthe method of direct observation, Theo-\r\nries of this type have always dominated\r\nthe field of human behavior.

This does not mean, as I shall show later, that intro-\r\nspection is a kind of physiological research, nor does it mean\r\n(and this is the heart of the argument) that what are felt\r\nor introspectively observed are the causes of behavior. An\r\norganism behaves as it does because of its current structure,\r\nbut imost of this is out of reach of introspection.

I believe I have written a consistent, coherent\r\naccount, but it reflects my own environmental history.\r\nBertrand Russell once pointed out that the experimental\r\nanimals studied by American behaviorists behaved like\r\nAmericans, running about in an almost random fashion,\r\nwhile those of Germans behaved like Germans, sitting and\r\nthinking. The remark may have been apt at the time, al-\r\nthough it is meaningless today. Nevertheless, he was right in\r\ninsisting that we are all culture-bound and that we approach\r\nthe study of behavior with preconceptions. (And so, of\r\ncourse, do philosophers. Russell's account of how people\r\nthink is very British, very Russellian. Mao Tse-tung's\r\nthoughts on the same subject are very Chinese. How could\r\nit be otherwise?)\r\nI have not presupposed any technical knowledge on the\r\npart of the reader. A few facts and principles will, I hope,\r\nbecome familiar enough to be useful, since the discussion\r\ncannot proceed in a vacuum, but the book is not about a\r\nscience of behavior but about its philosophy, and I have\r\nkept the scientific material to a bare minimum.

It is known that a delight tasted\r\nurges us to continue and add to it, and that without delibera\r\ntion or delay. Approaching an agreeable warmth when chilly,\r\nwe find ourselves giving way to an immediate impulse ; we\r\ndo not wait for the formalities supposed to attend a de\r\ncision of the will : it takes an effort on our part to resist\r\nthe movement so long as the pleasure is increasing.

A certain\r\nforce was doubtless exerted to enable it to retain this position ; but the first\r\ndecided exertion of the creature's own energy was shown in standing up on\r\nits legs, which it did after the pause of little more than a minute. The\r\npower thus put forth I can only describe as a spontaneous burst of the\r\nlocomotive\r\nenergy , under this condition, namely, that as all the four limbs\r\nwere actuated at the same instant , the innate power must have been guided\r\ninto this quadruple channel in consequence of that nervous organization\r\nthat constitutes the four limbs one related group. The animal now stood on\r\nits legs , the feet being considerably apart so as to widen the base of support.\r\nThe energy that raised it up continued flowing in order to maintain the\r\nstanding posture, and the animal doubtless had the consciousness of such a\r\nflow of energy , as its earliest mental experience. This standing posture\r\nwas continued for a minute or two in perfect stillness. Next followed the\r\nbeginnings of locomotive movement. At first a limb was raised and set\r\ndown again, then came a second movement that widened the animal's base\r\nwithout altering its position. When a more complex movement with two\r\nlimbs came on, the effect seemed to be to go sideways ; another complex\r\nmovement led forwards; but at the outset there appeared to be nothing to\r\ndecide one direction rather than another, for the earliest movements were a\r\njumble of side, forward, and backward. Still , the alternation of limb\r\nthat any consecutive advance required seemed within the power of the\r\ncreature during the first ten minutes of life . Sensation as yet could be of\r\nvery little avail, and it was evident that action took the start in the animal's\r\nhistory. The eyes were wide open , and light must needs have entered to\r\nstimulate the brain. The contact with the solid earth and the feelings of\r\nweight and movement were the earliest feelings. In this state of uncertain\r\nwandering with little change of place, the lamb was seized hold of and\r\ncarried up to the side of the mother. This made no difference till its nose\r\nwas brought into contact with the woolly skin of the dam , which originated\r\na new sensation. Then came a conjunction manifestly of the volitional\r\nkind. There was clearly a tendency to sustain this contact, to keep the\r\nnose rubbing upon the side and belly of the ewe. Finding a certain move\r\nment to have this effect, that movement was sustained ; exemplifying what\r\nI consider the primitive or fundamental fact of volition . \" Losing the\r\ncontact, there was as yet no power to recover it by a direct action, for the\r\nindications of sight at this stage had no meaning. The animal's spon\r\ntaneous irregular movements were continued ; for a time they were quite\r\nfruitless, until a chance contact came about again, and this contact could\r\nevidently sustain the posture or movement that was causing it . The whole\r\nof the first hour was spent in these various movements about the mother,\r\nthere being in that short time an evident increase of facility in the various\r\nacts of locomotion and in commanding the head in such a way as to keep\r\nup the agreeable touch .

If we can prove to satisfaction\r\na\r\nperhaps not much above aminute, it kept still in this attitude. A certain\r\nforce was doubtless exerted to enable it to retain this position ; but the first\r\ndecided exertion of the creature's own energy was shown in standing up on\r\nits legs, which it did after the pause of little more than a minute. The\r\npower thus put forth I can only describe as a spontaneous burst of the\r\nlocomotive\r\nenergy , under this condition, namely, that as all the four limbs\r\nwere actuated at the same instant , the innate power must have been guided\r\ninto this quadruple channel in consequence of that nervous organization\r\nthat constitutes the four limbs one related group. The animal now stood on\r\nits legs , the feet being considerably apart so as to widen the base of support.\r\nThe energy that raised it up continued flowing in order to maintain the\r\nstanding posture, and the animal doubtless had the consciousness of such a\r\nflow of energy , as its earliest mental experience. This standing posture\r\nwas continued for a minute or two in perfect stillness. Next followed the\r\nbeginnings of locomotive movement. At first a limb was raised and set\r\ndown again, then came a second movement that widened the animal's base\r\nwithout altering its position. When a more complex movement with two\r\nlimbs came on, the effect seemed to be to go sideways ; another complex\r\nmovement led forwards; but at the outset there appeared to be nothing to\r\ndecide one direction rather than another, for the earliest movements were a\r\njumble of side, forward, and backward. Still , the alternation of limb\r\nthat any consecutive advance required seemed within the power of the\r\ncreature during the first ten minutes of life . Sensation as yet could be of\r\nvery little avail, and it was evident that action took the start in the animal's\r\nhistory. The eyes were wide open , and light must needs have entered to\r\nstimulate the brain. The contact with the solid earth and the feelings of\r\nweight and movement were the earliest feelings. In this state of uncertain\r\nwandering with little change of place, the lamb was seized hold of and\r\ncarried up to the side of the mother. This made no difference till its nose\r\nwas brought into contact with the woolly skin of the dam , which originated\r\na new sensation. Then came a conjunction manifestly of the volitional\r\nkind. There was clearly a tendency to sustain this contact, to keep the\r\nnose rubbing upon the side and belly of the ewe. Finding a certain move\r\nment to have this effect, that movement was sustained ; exemplifying what\r\nI consider the primitive or fundamental fact of volition . \" Losing the\r\ncontact, there was as yet no power to recover it by a direct action, for the\r\nindications of sight at this stage had no meaning. The animal's spon\r\ntaneous irregular movements were continued ; for a time they were quite\r\nfruitless, until a chance contact came about again, and this contact could\r\nevidently sustain the posture or movement that was causing it . The whole\r\nof the first hour was spent in these various movements about the mother,\r\nthere being in that short time an evident increase of facility in the various\r\nacts of locomotion and in commanding the head in such a way as to keep\r\nup the agreeable touch . A second hour was spent much in the same\r\nmanner ; and in the course of the third hour, the animal, which had been\r\nentirely left to itself, came upon the teat, and got this into its mouth .\r\nThe spontaneous workings of the mouth now yielded a new sensation,\r\nwhereby they were animated and sustained, and unexpectedly the creature\r\nfound itself in the possession of a new pleasure ; the satisfaction first of\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:30:17.855Z","citation":"","pageIndex":453,"uniqueId":"BaiSenses55","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[BaiSenses55]] BainA - 1855 - The Senses and the Intellect.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[BaiSenses55]] BainA - 1855 - The Senses and the Intellect.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:30:17.889Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:17.855Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"89a3ee01-0988-44c9-8539-8aa22cfd4431","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-12T20:17:26.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:18.036Z","text":"developments in the self-education of those two lambs, but the above are\r\ncorrect statements to the best of my recollection.

I speak not at present either of\r\nthe complex case of dramatic imitation and mimicry, or of the\r\nsympathies with emotion, as in laughter, tears, &c.\r\n( 1.)

So far as my observation\r\ngoes, there is\r\nis very little during the first year. But a primitive\r\nimpulse ought to show itself much earlier than this. The\r\ninstinctive movements discussed in the preceding Book show\r\nmouthing the object-- next, by - and -bye, the pleasure of drawing milk ; the\r\nintensity of this last feeling would doubtless give an intense spur to the\r\nco -existing movements, andkeep them energetically at work. A new and\r\ngrand impression was thus produced, remaining after the fact, and stimu\r\nlating exertion and pursuit in order to recover it.\r\nSix or seven hours after birth the animal had made notable progress.\r\nLocomotion was easy, the forward movement being preferred, but not pre\r\ndominant. The sensations of sight began to have a meaning.

All emotions\r\nwere either ‘aggregations’ of feelings or transferred feelings that were\r\noriginally aroused by one object but were now, by association, aroused\r\nby a third object (as in classical conditioning). Bain, like Brown and\r\nSpencer, reduced ‘emotions’ to involuntary, non-cognitive feelings and\r\ntheir aggregations.\r\nTheory of the will\r\nBain, but not Spencer or Darwin, adopted the increasingly popular\r\nthreefold division of the mind into volition, cognition and emotion\r\n(various terms were used for the three categories – sometimes ‘will’ and\r\n‘intellect’ were used instead of ‘volition’ and ‘cognition’, and ‘conation’\r\nor ‘feeling’ were alternatives for ‘emotion’). It was noted in chapter \r\nthat there were already in the eighteenth century some signs of a shift,\r\naway from the classical model in which the mind comprised the two fac-\r\nulties or principles of will and intellect, and towards a model in which\r\nthere was a third faculty of feeling or affection. Classical Christian affec-\r\ntive psychology had relied on the distinction between intellect and will,\r\nboth of which were involved in the affections of the soul. The move to a\r\ntripartite model was a move away from that Christian psychology.\r\nBain gave as physicalist a sense to ‘will’ as he had to ‘emotion’: ‘The\r\nwill, volition, or voluntary action is, on the outside, a physical fact; animal\r\nmuscle under nervous stimulation is one of the mechanical prime movers;\r\nthe motive power of muscle is as purely physical as the motive power of\r\nsteam; food is to one what fuel is to the other.’ Volition, for Bain,\r\nwas just another emotion. And emotions, as we have seen, were, in turn,\r\ndefined as passive epiphenomenal feelings; the mental ‘side’ of ‘purely\r\nphysical’ nervous activity. Mill was right that Bain had brought activity\r\nback into the associationist psychology; but it was activity of the nerves\r\nand muscles rather than of a self-acting will, in the traditional sense.\r\n Bain (), .  Bain (), , –.  Bain (), –.\r\n On the other hand, the persistence of the bipartite division of psychology into the senses\r\nand the intellect on the one hand and the emotions and the will on the other in British\r\nand American textbooks in the later nineteenth century was indicative of the limited\r\ninroads made by the tripartite model – see chapter .\r\n Bain (), .

An undiscriminated difference would \r\nseem, indeed, to be indistinguishable from an undiscriminated iden- \r\ntity. But however that may be, one might well argue that there was no \r\nmore reason for supposing psychic life to begin with disjecta membra \r\nthan for the belief that bodily life so begins. So far as we are to be \r\nguided by the general principles of organic evolution, the only reason- \r\nable assumption to make is that early conscious life is relatively \r\namorphous, and does not possess anything so highly specialized as \r\nblues and reds, or high c's and middle a's. Instead of the gaze of \r\nthe infant, as it wanders aimlessly around, encountering a parti- \r\ncolored world, what it sees is more aptly to be described as \"excit- \r\ning, \" or \"vaguely urgent,\" or \"disquieting.\" As a matter of fact, \r\nhowever, the conscious content of a child is for long inexpressible \r\nin words at all; for words, being framed to denote the content of \r\nadult experience, are all hopelessly definite and discriminating. We \r\ncan hope at most only vaguely to characterize, and not to express or \r\ndescribe it. \r\nBut if the generally accepted position is so widely at variance \r\nwith the a priori probabilities, on what special grounds is it accepted ? \r\nSurely, one would suppose, there must be strong and substantial \r\narguments in its favor. If there are such arguments, however, they \r\nare not adduced by psychologists. The truth is that the doctrine in \r\nquestion seems to be one which, while tacitly accepted by almost every \r\none so long as it is not challenged, is not actively defended by any one. \r\nBut, though we do not find the doctrine actively defended, it is not \r\ndifficult to discover the sources of its hold upon philosophical and \r\npsychological thought. \r\nThe first of these is the tradition of English empiricism and asso- \r\nciationism,4 from which psychology in the last quarter-century has \r\nbeen struggling to free itself, not as yet with complete success.5 Ac- \r\ncording to this tradition, analytic simplicity was frankly identified \r\nwith genetic primacy, applied in political science, it led to individual- \r\nism and the social contract theory; applied in ethics, it produced the \r\nhedonism of the eighteenth century, in which happiness was supposed \r\nto be built up out of atomic increments of pleasure; applied in logic, \r\nit resulted in the well-known theory that judgments come after con- \r\ncepts and are made out of them, while judgments in turn are put \r\ntogether to form syllogisms. But nowhere has the deceptive truth \r\nthat \"the simple precedes the complex\" had wider application than \r\n4 This tradition is not, it is true, confined to empiricism, but was the com- \r\nmon possession of all the thought of the period. The social-contract theory, for \r\nexample, was not originated by empiricists. \r\n6 See article, \" The Psychological Element.\" \r\nThis content downloaded from 193.104.110.35 on Fri, 23 May 2014 23:02:49 PM\r\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:30:18.441Z","citation":"","pageIndex":4,"uniqueId":"deSensation16a","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[deSensation16a]] de LagunaG - 1916 - Sensation and Perception - I - The Genetic Relationship.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[deSensation16a]] de LagunaG - 1916 - Sensation and Perception - I - The Genetic Relationship.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:30:18.504Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:30:18.441Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"c2d0503d-5e48-4efd-a4c8-bd0d2ca8abd0","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-24T00:56:35.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:28:11.737Z","text":"This work is evidently the most important, from the social\r\nand economic standpoints, necessitated by the great war,\r\nsince hundreds of thousands of soldiers are being returned to\r\nsociety partially incapacitated by paralysis or by the loss or\r\ninjury of members.

A brief statement\r\nconcerning the work of the committee prepared by its director,\r\nDr. Scott, on November 12 follows:\r\nMy dear Major Yerkes: The work of the committee on classifi-\r\ncation of personnel in the Army is of such a nature that it is very\r\ndifficult to state the exact date on which any work begins and is\r\nended. In fact, practically all of our work has developed gradually\r\nand so far as we can see now, will never end. It is therefore difficult\r\nto give any report.\r\nThe following statement, however, will, in a way, conform with\r\nyour request of November 6:\r\n1. The Rating Scale was made the form for recommending\r\ncandidates for promotion in eight of the first series of officers'\r\ntraining camps.\r\n2. In the second series of officers' training camps, a permanent\r\nrecord and a rating scale and a pocket rating card were introduced\r\nand made a regular part of the system.\r\n3. For selecting candidates for the third series of officers'\r\ntraining camps, the rating scale, a special form of making reports\r\nand a pocket rating card are made the official forms.\r\n4. A personnel department has been established in each of the\r\nthirty-one divisions now in the United States. Sixteen civilian\r\nexperts have been employed by the committee to install the per-\r\nsonnel department and these sixteen civilians are cooperating with\r\npossibly two thousand officers and enlisted men who are devoting\r\ntheir time to this army work. In some of the divisions, this per-\r\nsonnel work is developing very rapidly. This is notably true in the\r\ncase of Camp Upton, where as many as seventy-two officers and\r\nthree hundred enlisted men have been employed on the work at the\r\nsame time.\r\n5. The committee has cooperated in the work of psychological\r\nexamining which is being conducted in four of the cantonments by\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:28:11.806Z","citation":"","pageIndex":22,"uniqueId":"YerPsychology18","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[YerPsychology18]] YerkesR - 1918 - Psychology in relation to the war.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[YerPsychology18]] YerkesR - 1918 - Psychology in relation to the war.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:28:11.810Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:28:11.806Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"e6fa8766-ba40-4843-88c6-4b8eb54b7f5d","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-24T01:08:07.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:28:11.824Z","text":"Meantime, Professor Watson, who in August became a\r\nmember of the committee on classification of personnel in\r\nthe Army, accepted appointment as major in the Signal\r\nCorps and was placed on duty in the division of personnel.\r\nHe has been responsible for the organizing of methods, other\r\nthan the medical, of the aviational examining boards, and\r\nhas further been charged with the direction of the work of a\r\ngroup of research psychologists.\r\nHis own summary statement concerning this work, which\r\npertains to the effects of high altitude, is presented herewith:\r\n","title":"Yerkes included a report by Waston who was respons","importance":0,"tags":[],"comments":[{"id":"0277b2a9-b9a2-43dc-959f-f145c153e04e","extra":"","text":"Yerkes included a report by Waston who was responsible for researching ways to measure fitness of personel for aviation.

We are acting not individually\r\nbut collectively on the basis of common training and common\r\nfaith in the practical value of our work. At the first call\r\nAmerican psychologists responded promptly and heartily,\r\ntherefore the length to which the development of our work\r\nhas progressed and the measure of service which has been\r\nattained.\r\nOn April 6, 1917, in connection with a meeting of a group\r\nof psychologists known as the \"Experimentalists\" which was\r\nat the time being held in Emerson Hall, Cambridge, Massa-\r\nchusetts, a session was arranged by Messrs. Langfeld and\r\nYerkes with the approval of the chairman of the meeting,\r\nMr. Titchener, for discussion of the relations of psychology\r\nto national defense.

Around 1970 his lectures \r\nmoved from seminar rooms to football stadiums. In 1971 he published a \r\nsummary of behaviorist philosophy that stayed on the New York Times \r\nbest- seller list for twenty weeks. The provocatively titled Beyond Freedom \r\nand Dignity laid out his utilitarian blueprint for solving the “terrifying \r\nproblems that face us in the world today,” including population explo-\r\nsion, nuclear holocaust, famine, disease, and pollution. The humanists, \r\nhe scoffed, appealed to explanations such as “attitudes,” “opinions,” and \r\n“personalities” to account for self- destructiveness. Skinner’s aim was \r\nto replace the misleading language of internal mental states with un-\r\nadorned descriptions of human behaviors. That year he made forty radio \r\nand television appearances.85\r\nSkinner’s principal target was a specter he called “autonomous man,” \r\nwhich he derided as an Enlightenment superstition, heaping contempt \r\non “the literature of freedom.”86 “Autonomous man,” he sneered, “serves \r\nto explain only the things we are not yet able to explain in other ways.”87 \r\n“Responsibility” was another symptom of our pathetic ignorance. If we \r\nknew how criminality was caused, we would not need any such vacuous \r\nnotion. “We shall not solve the problems of alcoholism and juvenile de-\r\nlinquency by increasing a sense of responsibility. It is the environment \r\nwhich is ‘responsible’ for the objectionable behavior.”88 The metaphysical \r\nillusion of moral freedom was not only irrational, it was pernicious, im-\r\npeding “the design of better environments rather than of better men.”89\r\nOne of the most ticklish questions Skinner confronted in the book was \r\nhow to justify his prescriptions in terms that he deemed appropriate to \r\nscience. Scientific credibility required that he present his plans for a better \r\nworld as somehow value- free. The title Beyond Freedom and Dignity was \r\na tribute to Friedrich Nietzsche’s brilliant manifesto of amorality Beyond \r\nGood and Evil, but Skinner spake more like Hobbes than Zarathustra. \r\nHis argument was completely Hobbesian: goodness was just a word for \r\npleasantness, and the whole thing was predicated on brute survival.

A 1949 paper in Psychological Review accused \r\nbehaviorism of having a “static, atomistic character,” lacking creativity, \r\nneglecting questions of value, intensifying scientific hierarchies, and be-\r\ning devoid of “vitality and courage.”45 At Skinner’s home institution of \r\nHarvard, the antibehaviorists founded the interdisciplinary Department \r\nof Social Relations, “identified by its interests in personality, social issues, \r\nand a commitment to the view that humans are naturally autonomous.” \r\nSkinner and his mentors were left behind to rule over a psychology de-\r\npartment defined by a rigidly deterministic perspective on human na-\r\nture.46 As the two sides entrenched, antibehaviorist critiques tended \r\nmore toward the insultingly diagnostic, with an important 1959 survey of \r\npsychological science denouncing behaviorism’s “attachment to a ‘facile’ \r\nmythology of perfection, as well as its ‘autism.’”47\r\nFor its critics, the behaviorist universe was devoid, above all, of mean-\r\ning. There seemed to be no place in it for concepts, judgments, values, \r\nintentions, or beliefs. The question of meaning was best exemplified, of \r\ncourse, by syntactical language. How could a stimulus- response analysis \r\npossibly account for the importance of word order in generating sense or \r\nnonsense? How could operant conditioning explain the proverbial news-\r\nworthiness of “man bites dog”? Taking up the gauntlet, in 1957 Skinner \r\npublished an audacious treatise on Verbal Behavior in which he asserted \r\nthat all linguistic phenomena could be analyzed in behaviorist terms: the \r\nmeaning of words was a function of the reward given for a certain behav-\r\nior, such as looking at a chair, uttering “chair,” and being rewarded by a \r\nparent’s delighted hand- clapping.\r\nThe book was received politely at first, until the linguist Noam \r\nChomsky published a long, damning review, claiming that the theory of \r\noperant conditioning might contain valuable insights into the psychol-\r\nogy of rats and pigeons, but extrapolating it to human symbolic language \r\ndeprived it of all its precision.

In studying the former, one concentrates\r\non the responses which come after the stimu-\r\nlus. In studying the latter, one looks mainly\r\nat the responses which precede it. In its\r\nreinforcing capacity, a stimulus increases,\r\ndecreases, or leaves unchanged the frequency\r\nof preceding responses, and accordingly it is\r\ncalled a reward, a punishment, or a neutral\r\nstimulus (cf. 16).\r\nPrevious studies using chronic implantation\r\nof electrodes have tended to focus on the\r\neliciting functions of electrical stimuli de-\r\nlivered to the brain (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14).\r\nThe present study, on the other hand, has\r\nbeen concerned with the reinforcing function\r\nof the electrical st imulation.3\r\nMETHOD\r\nGeneral\r\nStimulation was carried out by means of chronically\r\nimplanted electrodes which did not interfere with the\r\nhealth or free behavior of Ss to any appreciable extent.\r\nThe .9s were 15 male hooded rats, weighing approxi-\r\nmately 250 gm. at the start of the experiment. Each\r\nS was tested in a Skinner box which delivered alternat-\r\ning current to the brain so long as a lever was depressed.\r\nThe current was delivered over a loose lead, suspended\r\nfrom the ceiling, which connected the stimulator to the\r\nrat's electrode. The 5s were given a total of 6 to 12 hr.\r\nof acquisition testing, and 1 to 2 hr. of extinction test-\r\ning.

A detailed report of\r\nthe locus of positive, negative, and neutral reinforcing\r\neffects of electrical brain stimulation is being prepared\r\nby the first author.\r\nso that a response produced electrical stimulation;\r\nduring extinction, the stimulator was turned off so\r\nthat a response produced no electrical stimulation.\r\nEach S was given a percentage score denoting the\r\nproportion of his total acquisition time given to re-\r\nsponding. This score could be compared with the\r\nanimal's extinction score to determine whether the\r\nstimulation had a positive, negative, or neutral rein-\r\nforcing effect. After testing, the animal was sacrificed.\r\nIts brain was frozen, sectioned, stained, and examined\r\nmicroscopically to determine which structure of the\r\nbrain had been stimulated. This permitted correlation\r\nof acquisition scores with anatomical structures.\r\nElectrode Implantation\r\nElectrodes are constructed by cementing a pair of\r\nenameled silver wires of 0.010-in. diameter into a 1/ucilc\r\nblock, as shown in Figure 1. The parts of the wires\r\nwhich penetrate the brain arc cemented together to\r\nform a needle, and this is cut to the correct length\r\nto reach the desired structure in the brain. This length\r\nis determined from Krieg's rat brain atlas (11) with\r\nslight modifications as found necessary by experience.\r\nThe exposed cross section of the wire is the only part\r\nof the needle not insulated from the brain by enamel;\r\nstimulation therefore occurs only at the tip. Contact\r\nwith the lead from the stimulator is made through\r\ntwo blobs of solder on the upper ends of the electrode\r\nwires; these blobs make contact with the jaws of an\r\nalligator clip which has been modified to insulate the\r\ntwo jaws from one another. A light, flexible hearing-aid\r\nlead connects the clip to the voltage source.\r\nThe operation of implantation is performed with the\r\nrat under Nembutal anesthesia (0.88 cc/Kg) and held\r\nin a Johnson-Krieg stereotaxic instrument (11). A\r\nmid-line incision is made in the scalp and the skin\r\nheld out of the way by muscle retractors. A small hole\r\nis drilled in the skull with a dental burr at the point\r\nindicated by the stereotaxic instrument for the struc-\r\nture it is desired to stimulate. The electrode, which is\r\nclamped into the needle carrier of the instrument, is\r\nlowered until the flange of the F-ucite block rests firmly\r\non the skull. Four screw holes are then drilled in the\r\nskull through four fixing holes in the flange, and the\r\nelectrode, still clamped firmly in the instrument, is\r\nfastened to the skull with jeweler's screws which exceed\r\nthe diameter of the screw holes in the skull by 0.006 in.\r\nThe electrode is then released from the clamp and the\r\nscalp wound closed with silk sutures. The skin is pulled\r\nlightly around the base of the Lucite block and kept\r\nwell away from the contact plates. A recovery period\r\nof three days is allowed after the operation before\r\ntesting.

In a recent article2\r\nI have pointed out how Freud has inclined in his later writings to give\r\nprimacy to the hormic principle, and to make less of his ‘pleasure\r\nprinciple.’ Freud’s psychology seems to me to show clearly that this\r\ncombination of the two principles, the attempt to run them in double\r\nharness, results in confusion and error, both theoretical and practical.\r\nMy purpose in this paper is to try to show that a purely hormic\r\npsychology is tenable.

The\r\ngoal in itself may be of little or no intrinsic value ; it may be the barren\r\nand shapeless top of a mountain enshrouded in thick mist. But we have\r\ndesired it, have striven for it, have attained it, and pleasure or satisfac¬\r\ntion results. On the other hand, as we strive, every check, every thwart¬\r\ning brings unpleasure, and final failure leaves us steeped in gloom.\r\nThe principle here enunciated is widely recognized as a general law\r\nof conation, even by some of those who accept also the hedonic principle.\r\nJames Ward, for example, made subjective or hedonic selection funda¬\r\nmental in his psychology; he wrote: “The broad generalization already\r\nmade may hold, viz. that receptive states lead through feeling to active\r\nstates, and that those which are neither pleasant nor unpleasant, that\r\n1 Dr E.

In the psychology of the classical associationism\r\nof the utilitarian school, hedonism (I omit henceforth the qualifying\r\n‘psychological’) and associative reproduction were the two governing\r\nprinciples of all mental process. But many other writers of great authority\r\nwho gave to association a lesser role in our mental life were essentially\r\nhedonists, in that they regarded conation as determined or evoked by\r\npleasure or pain; Lotze, Bain, Wundt, James Ward may be mentioned.\r\nHedonism has perhaps relatively fewer exponents at the present day.\r\nA large number of psychologists have adopted a strictly mechanistic\r\nview of mental life and behaviour, a view which finds no place for pleasure\r\nand pain, or at least assigns to them no role. Others, like Prof. E. Thorn¬\r\ndike, adopting a mechanistic interpretation of behaviour, deny all\r\npurposive activity, all goal-seeking, all striving towards ends; yet\r\ncontinue to assign to pleasure and pain the quasi-mechanical functions\r\nof ‘stamping in’ or ‘stamping out’ associations or brain-links for¬\r\ntuitously formed.\r\nAmong many of those who are not strict mechanists, who recognize\r\nconation, striving towards ends, goal-seeking, conative impulse, desire\r\nand volition as other than mechanical sequences, hedonism continues\r\nto be accepted ; and by many it is combined in various ways and degrees\r\nwith the hormic theory.\r\nBy the hormic theory I mean the view (which comes down to us from\r\nAristotle) that men and animals are natively endowed with dispositions\r\nor tendencies to strive towards certain goals proper to the species, such\r\ntendencies being brought into play and guided by cognition of appro¬\r\npriate objects.\r\nVery few authors have expounded this theory in its pure form, or\r\nhave attempted a purely hormic psychology of action.

Tolman, 1 952a) ,  was interested in motivational concepts throughout his career. H owever, in several  early publications, he expressed two concerns with McDo ugal l ' s  approach. First, he characterized McDougal l  as an introspectionist and his theory as mentalistic. \r\nConsider, for example, McDougall's definition in terms of emotions . Pugnacity, he defines, as the accompaniment of anger. According to his expl ic it doctrine, then, anger is the thing which is known and obvious, while pugnacity the thing which has to be inferred therefrom. But implicitly and in actua l i ty his procedure, it seems to the reviewer, has to be just the reverse .  For pugnacity, not  anger, is the thing actually observed .  How arc we certain of anger in another individual? Only by virtue of the pugnacity of his behavior? If the other individual did not  bchmx in a pugnacious way, we could never be certain that he was angry. Even, if he introspected and told us he was angry, we would not bel ieve him unless his remarks were sooner or later verified by actual pugnacious behavior. In short, it must be the behavior which defines the emotion, rather than the emotion which defines the behavior (E. C. Tolman, 1 923a, p. 209, ital ics in original) . \r\nTolman's criticism foreshadowed many of his remarks in the coming years on mentalism and the problems of introspection .  H e  insisted that emotions be defined in terms of behavior, rather than on the basis of private experience . In addition, he noted that defining instincts as behav­iors was particularly important if one wished to study instincts in animals. Tolman also took issue with McDougal l ' s  approach  as treating instincts as \"a definite and stereotyped action (i . e . ,  that i t  is  an inheritt!d reflex panem)\" (E. C. Tolman, 1 920, p .  222) . Whereas  McDougall defined primary instincts in terms of simple stimulus-response sequences, such as running in the case of fright or s triking in th e  case of fear, Tolman emphasized the more general nature of these responses as \"not running away or walking away, or flying away, but  merely as getting away, irrespective of the particular form of  locomotion employed\" (E. C. Tolman, 1 922b, p. 1 48) . Such statements anticipatt!d Tolman's later development of what came to be  ca l l ed molar behaviorism. He wanted to emphasize what behavior accompl ished or what function it served, rather than the specific responses . Tolman proposed a two-level theory of instincts that  included  subor­dinate acts and determining adjustments. Subordinate acts were activ­ities such as biting, chewing, and swallowing, which forme d  part of a \r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:27:29.360Z","citation":"","pageIndex":92,"uniqueId":"CarPurpose17","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[CarPurpose17]] CarrollD - 2017 - Purpose and Cognition - Edward Tolman and the Transformation of American Psychology.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[CarPurpose17]] CarrollD - 2017 - Purpose and Cognition - Edward Tolman and the Transformation of American Psychology.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:27:29.378Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:29.360Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"134a5625-8f33-4d41-9eeb-99eb27c9f991","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-24T12:45:05.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:29.419Z","text":"The exchange continued through several more rounds .

In contrast to Kuo, Tolman was interested in the inheritance of  learn­ing. He published what has been characterized as the first study of selective breeding for maze learning in rats . He first ran eighty-one rats in an enclosed maze and measured their performance in terms of errors, speed, and number of perfect runs. He then mated the top-scoring males and females to form a \"maze-bright\" strain, and the lowest scoring rats formed a \"maze-dull\" strain. The offspring of these su-ains then were tested on the maze . Eight new pairs from the first selected generation were selected to continue the study and a second selected generation was then tested. The study was a qualified success: in the first selected gener­ation, the maze-bright rats performed better than the earl ier unselected animals, whereas the maze-dull strain performed worse .  H owever, the second selected generation regressed to the mean (E. C .  Tolman ,  1 924) .

Fol lowing a visit with Kathl een's sister in London, they took Deborah and her younger sister Mary, now five and two years of age, to a small facil ity for the temporary care of  children in Cambridge . In late September, whi l e  in Paris with the Berkeley philosopher Stephen Pepper and his wife, the Tolmans learned that there had been a raging fire in the Berkeley Hi l l s  that destroyed both the Tolman and Pepper homes (Kent, 2003) . When Tolman retu rned from Europe, his graduate student Robert Tryon carried on the behavior genetic research . Tryon thought that Tolman's initial study had several m ethodological problems, including a maze of questionable rel iabi l i ty and insufficient control of environ­mental variables, such as the handling of the animals .  A subsequent study corrected some of the issues .  Tryon also bel ieved that it was necessary to study selective breeding across more than two generations and commit­ted to a research program that took more than a decade. By then, Tol­man had moved on to o ther interests . Ultimately, Tryon assembled an impressive body of research . By carrying out the studies over twenty-one generations, he found that the effects were so large that there was no overlap between the distribu tions of maze-bright and maze-dull animals. That is, the fastest learner in the dul l  group was slower than the slowest in the bright group (Schlesinger, 1 99 1 ;  Tryon, Tolman, & Jeffress, 1 929) . Although Tolman d id  not pursue the study of behavioral genetics throughout his career, his early studies of selective breeding informed his thinking about the determinants of l earning. He never endorsed the version of behaviorism that asserted that heredity played no role in learning. To the contrary, he  would explicitly  include it as a variable in the theory he presented to the American Psychological Association (APA) during his presidentia l  address m any years later (E. C. Tolman, 1938a) .  However, Tolman's  interest in instincts had less to do with measuring the influence of heredity on learning than it did with charac­terizing instincts in a new way. Tol man's goal was to demonstrate how a purposive psychology could be objective . By defining instincts as purpos­ive behavior, Tolman was attempting to distance himself both from mentalism and from some of the more simpl istic versions of behaviorism (Innis, 1 992a) . His early work on instincts was also a first attempt to characterize the motivational bases o f  animal  l earning. As Feest (2005a) has noted, although Tolman was critical of McDougall 's approach to instincts, he nonethe less recognized the importance of motivational concepts. He emphasized that animals were motivated to learn, not merely able to do so.

In the psychology of the classical associationism\r\nof the utilitarian school, hedonism (I omit henceforth the qualifying\r\n‘psychological’) and associative reproduction were the two governing\r\nprinciples of all mental process. But many other writers of great authority\r\nwho gave to association a lesser role in our mental life were essentially\r\nhedonists, in that they regarded conation as determined or evoked by\r\npleasure or pain; Lotze, Bain, Wundt, James Ward may be mentioned.\r\nHedonism has perhaps relatively fewer exponents at the present day.\r\nA large number of psychologists have adopted a strictly mechanistic\r\nview of mental life and behaviour, a view which finds no place for pleasure\r\nand pain, or at least assigns to them no role. Others, like Prof. E. Thorn¬\r\ndike, adopting a mechanistic interpretation of behaviour, deny all\r\npurposive activity, all goal-seeking, all striving towards ends; yet\r\ncontinue to assign to pleasure and pain the quasi-mechanical functions\r\nof ‘stamping in’ or ‘stamping out’ associations or brain-links for¬\r\ntuitously formed.\r\nAmong many of those who are not strict mechanists, who recognize\r\nconation, striving towards ends, goal-seeking, conative impulse, desire\r\nand volition as other than mechanical sequences, hedonism continues\r\nto be accepted ; and by many it is combined in various ways and degrees\r\nwith the hormic theory.\r\nBy the hormic theory I mean the view (which comes down to us from\r\nAristotle) that men and animals are natively endowed with dispositions\r\nor tendencies to strive towards certain goals proper to the species, such\r\ntendencies being brought into play and guided by cognition of appro¬\r\npriate objects.\r\nVery few authors have expounded this theory in its pure form, or\r\nhave attempted a purely hormic psychology of action.

The twentieth century has also seen an emphasis on what \r\nis called psychological hedonism, a conception which in its simplest \r\nform is Thorndike's law of effect—the notion that pleasure assures \r\nits own recurrence by reinforcing the learning of the actions which \r\nhave led to it.\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:27:45.424Z","citation":"","pageIndex":713,"uniqueId":"BorHistory50","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[BorHistory50]] BoringE - 1950 - A History of Experimental Psychology.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[BorHistory50]] BoringE - 1950 - A History of Experimental Psychology.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:27:45.445Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:45.424Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"b8fbe2f5-31e5-4835-8c3a-7f0572d42201","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-24T13:05:01.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:45.486Z","text":"Man experiences effort.

Nor is it an etymological accident that both \r\nthese words are related to tension.

So it becomes obvious that psychology \r\nhas to consider the activity of an organism which acts in accordance \r\nwith tensions which are its potentialities for action.\r\nWe have just'noted that Janet came over to such a view in his \r\ndynamic psychology, and we shall presently assess the concepts of \r\ntension and activity in the systems of Freud, McDougall, Lewin and \r\nother dynamicists. These men were trying to bring psychology \r\nback from straight description of conscious content or behavior to \r\nan account of how thought and conduct change and how struggle \r\nand frustration are the essence of living in the perpetually goal-di­\r\nrected organism. Dynamic psychology thus includes purposive psy­\r\nchology.\r\nThe present section of this book is inserted for the purpose of \r\nreminding the reader where we have already considered the con­\r\nception of active ideas and of tension and intent, for there can be \r\nfound part of the background for dynamic psychology.\r\nLeibnitz begins the tradition with his monadology. Each monad \r\nis active, striving independently for its own realization. Activity and \r\nconsciousness are two words for the same thing. The active devel­\r\nopment of an idea consists in its clarification, and thus you have \r\ndegrees of consciousness because the ideas grow from petites per­\r\nceptions up to their conscious actualization in apperception. To \r\nspeak of degrees of consciousness is to imply the existence of a \r\nthreshold of consciousness at each degree. The lower degrees are \r\nless conscious—unconscious but less. (See pp. 166-168.) All this \r\nconceptualization passes over into Herbarfs, Freud's and McDou- \r\ngalPs views with less change than one might expect.\r\nHerbart dealt with a dyntnmcs of the soul. Its ideas are all strug­\r\ngling for realization in consciousness, kept down in a state of ten­\r\ndency below the limen of consciousness because there is not enough \r\nroom for all in consciousness. The ideas thus come into convict and \r\ninhibit one another. Their realization in apperception above the \r\nthreshold is determined by the mechanics of their interaction. (See \r\npp. 255-260.) Here we have activity (induced by tension), the \r\nthreshold of consciousness, and, in addition, something new—the \r\nconception of conflict among the ideas, mutual inhibition and reso­\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:27:45.482Z","citation":"","pageIndex":722,"uniqueId":"BorHistory50","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[BorHistory50]] BoringE - 1950 - A History of Experimental Psychology.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[BorHistory50]] BoringE - 1950 - A History of Experimental Psychology.pdf","modified":"2022-08-02T18:27:45.494Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:45.482Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"8573939a-c747-41b6-9567-db9ff03727c4","extra":"","modified":"2022-07-24T13:08:10.000Z","created":"2022-08-02T18:27:45.519Z","text":"The great motivational theory of the eighteenth century was \r\nhedonism, and it lasted well over into the nineteenth.

His theory of actuality pre­\r\nvents him from being a static psychologist. He made, moreover, the \r\ngrand gesture toward dynamics by giving his elements the name \r\nprocess^ thereby admitting the Leibnitzian contention that activity \r\nis basic to consciousness. (See pp. 334-336.) These items are, of \r\ncourse, Wundt's exceptions, which show him compromising with \r\nnecessity. His most definite relation to dynamic psychology was \r\nthat he moved psychology far enough away from it to build up the \r\ntensions that brought its return.\r\nBrentano is, of course, the symbol of act psychology and the \r\nleader of the school. He substituted acts for contents and described \r\nthe acts by their intentionality (pp. 359-361). His influence was \r\nvery great, and, besides, he had the rightness of the obvious on his \r\nside: anyone could see by the scantiest introspection that mind is \r\nintentional and directed upon objects. Brentano won Stumpf to his \r\nside (pp. 367 f., 452) and eventually, if one speaks generally, Kiilpe \r\n(pp. 408 f., 451 f.). He had numerous followers who patterned their \r\nviews on his—for example, Witasek and Messer (pp. 449 f.). It is \r\nknown that Freud, at Brentano's recommendation, translated into \r\nGerman the twelfth volume of Theodor Gomperz's edition of John \r\nStuart Mill's Gesammelte Werke^ thus coming into contact with \r\nboth Brentano and Mill at the same time. Freud was Brentano's stu­\r\ndent and took six courses in philosophy with him during four semes­\r\nters in 1874-1876. Did Freud find it easier to believe in active ideas \r\nbecause he had sat under Brentano?

It has also gained support from some \r\nof the British associationists—Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Hartley, the \r\nMills, Spencer—because the principle of association seemed neces­\r\nsary to explain why men would suffer present pain in order to win \r\nfuture pleasure. Actually, hedonism goes back to the Greeks, to the \r\nwritings of Socrates' pupil, Aristippos (ca. 435-356 b.c.) and to \r\nEpicuros (341-270 b.c.).\r\nTroland has distinguished three kinds of hedonism—hedonism of \r\nthe present, of the future and of the past. Hedonism of the present \r\nwas the doctrine of Aristippos and the Cyrenaics that immediate \r\npleasure is the simmim bonum of human action. That in itself is an \r\nethical canon, since it lays down what man ought to do. It would be \r\na psychological theory if it stated that man always or usually acts \r\nto gain immediate pleasure or to avoid immediate pain, and in that \r\nform it would be more nearly tenable of animals which lack the \r\nsymbolic processes necessary for the anticipation of the future than \r\nof man who is always looking forward. As ethics the simple theory \r\nquickly becomes involved in contradictions and the Epicureans \r\nmodified it greatly in the direction of taking account of future \r\npleasure and pain.\r\nThe hedonism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was \r\nbasically a hedonism of the -future as well as a hedonism of the com­\r\nmunity. Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Bentham and the two Mills were \r\nconcerned with the state and society. If the individual seeks only his \r\nimmediate pleasure, he finds that pain is often the delayed conse­\r\nquence. Given time, profligacy results badly. Hence the individual \r\nmust learn prudence, a fact which the Epicureans recognized. There \r\nare, moreover, the cases of human conflict, which come about \r\nwhen one man's pleasure is another's pain. How then, the philoso­\r\npher asks, can the pleasure of the future be assured? It can not be \r\nwhen human desires conflict, as they inevitably do. For this reason \r\nthe utilitarians, of whom Bentham was the premier and exemplar, \r\nargued that you must apply the hedonistic principle to the com­\r\nmunity, integrating pleasures and pains, and taking “the greatest \r\ngood to the greatest number” as the social goal.\r\nIt is here that association comes in. Each individual accepts the \r\ncommunal goal because the alternative is conflict, which provides \r\npain and no pleasure for all parties. Presently the individual comes \r\nto associate pleasure instead of pain with those actions which lead \r\nto the communal goal, to the greatest pleasure for the greatest \r\nnumber. In this way the altruistic impulses are built up.

He was also influenced \r\nby Adam Smith, whose Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the \r\nWealth of Nations appeared in 1776. Smith had argued that the \r\ngreatest wealth and happiness of nations come from the exercise of \r\nself-interest in free trade. Smith was not a reformer, but Bentham, \r\nyoung enough to be escaping from the complacency of the eight­\r\neenth century into the radical nineteenth, saw the utilitarian prin­\r\nciple as a cause to champion. He published An Introduction to the \r\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation in 1779. \"Nothing can act of \r\nitself as a motive but the ideas of pleasure or pain.\" Human action \r\noccurs “under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and \r\npleasure.n All action is self-interested, but free self-interest results \r\nin \"the greatest good to the greatest number,n which is measured by \r\nthe “sum total of human happiness.\" The familiarity of those phrases \r\nshows how the utilitarian philosophy has penetrated present-day \r\ncommon sense.\r\nBentham was not a liberal in the modern sense. He believed firmly \r\nin established authority. He said that talk about liberty and the \r\nrights of man was nonsense, that the greatest good to the greatest \r\nnumber depended on security, not on liberty, and that punishment \r\nis a means by which self-interest is persuaded to support authority.\r\nBentham impressed James Mill (1773-1836), who was his junior \r\nby twenty-five years and who took over his doctrine, presenting it, \r\nas he did that other doctrine, associationism, in such rigid and un­\r\ncompromising terms as to alienate the more flexible minds. Then, \r\nabout 1822, the young John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), aged sixteen, \r\ndominated by his father, took up with the doctrine enthusiastically. \r\nFour years later, however, he reacted against the principle as being \r\noversimplified and opposed to humanitarian ethics. He maintained \r\nthat benevolence is not based solely on self-interest. After Bentham \r\ndied in 1832, John Mill attacked the Benthamites, remaining, how­\r\never, a sophisticated utilitarian. His essay on UtilitarianisTn, pub­\r\nlished in 1863, was a much cited classic, effective in maintaining the \r\npolitical, but not the psychological, hedonistic doctrine.\r\nHerbert Spencer (1820-1903) brought utilitarianism into relation \r\nwith evolutionism.

It \r\nis an interest and a concern. It is also a movement for those \r\npsychologists who, disappointed in the description of consciousness \r\nand behavior, seek a more satisfying psychology of what they some­\r\ntimes call “human nature.\" The psychology of human nature is a \r\nmotivational psychology, because the prediction and control of be­\r\nhavior is the most important practical thing to know about man as \r\na living, choosing, adapting organism. Thus dynamic psychology is \r\nnot a school. It has no leader, no founder. The dynamic psychologists \r\ndo not like to wear a party label, as the behaviorists did. Most of \r\nthe psychologists who make propaganda for dynamic psychology \r\nare not interested solely in the topic of motivation but are exerting \r\nthemselves to enlarge psychology so that it will cover what they \r\nbelieve is a neglected field.\r\nOn the other hand, dynamic psychology, while not a school, in­\r\ncludes a number of schools.

For \r\nour purposes, what is interesting is Jevons’s assumption that people were \r\nengaged in a constant quest to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. \r\nFrom this foundation he raised a whole science, in which the economic \r\nactivities of “buying and selling, borrowing and lending, laboring and \r\nresting, producing and consuming” manifest the pains and pleasures of \r\nthe human organism.29 “Almost unconsciously we make calculations of \r\nthis kind more or less accurately in all the ordinary affairs of life,” he \r\ndeclared.30 For Jevons, the measurable facts of economic activity were \r\nsymptoms of human misery and delight, an assumption about the psy-\r\nchological underpinnings of getting and spending that required no fur-\r\nther explication.\r\nJevons was pessimistic about the possibility of any sort of direct mea-\r\nsurement of pain and pleasure, but his immediate successor, the econo-\r\nmist Francis Edgeworth, refused to give in to these technical shortcom-\r\nings. In a short book called Mathematical Psychics, Edgeworth proposed \r\nthat although “hedonism may still be in the state of heat or electricity \r\nbefore they became exact sciences,” the measurement of pain and plea-\r\nsure would one day be possible. To this end, he conjured up an imaginary \r\n“psychophysical machine” that he called the “hedonimeter”:\r\nFrom moment to moment the hedonimeter varies; the index now flicker-\r\ning with the flutter of the passions, now steadied by intellectual activity, \r\nlow sunk whole hours in the neighbourhood of zero, or momentarily \r\nspringing up towards infinity. . . .

The hu-\r\nman subjects were given a classical strategic game to play, in which an \r\n“employee” had to decide whether to “work or shirk” and an “employer” \r\nhad to make up her mind to “inspect or not inspect” (a panoptic setup \r\nof which Bentham would surely approve).

It turned out that the ducks quickly \r\narranged themselves in front of the researchers in such as way as to max-\r\nimize their chances of grabbing a bite to eat. When the bread- throwing \r\nrate was altered, the ducks rearranged themselves into a “perfect equi-\r\nlibrium” within seconds. Impressed, the authors concluded that “the \r\nducks as a group behaved in a perfectly rational manner, in a manner \r\nthat many economists would argue was evidence of a rational conscious \r\nprocess if this same behavior had been produced by humans operat-\r\ning under simple market conditions like these.” The last sections of the \r\npaper moved into neurochemical territory to explain this result.

In 1988 two influential con-\r\nservative economists proposed “a theory of rational addiction in which \r\nrationality means a consistent plan to maximize utility over time.”47 Their \r\ndefinitions of both addiction and rationality were completely Skinner-\r\nian: “A person is potentially addicted to c,” they announced, “if an in-\r\ncrease in his current consumption of c increases his future consumption \r\nof c. . . . Reinforcement means that a greater current consumption of a \r\ngood raises its future consumption.”48 The paper showed how this rela-\r\ntion between current and future consumption— “drug tolerance” to you \r\nand me— could be mathematically modeled. Although it was necessary \r\nto assume steep indifference to future happiness in the calculations of \r\nthe addict, the model still portrayed taking heroin as a rational activ-\r\nity.

Because of\r\ntheir commitment to analysis, Mechanists have tended to hold to some kind of\r\nreductionist strategy, that is, the belief that to understand higher level processes it\r\nis necessary to investigate them at lower levels of organization: for example, cells\r\nin terms of molecules, organs in terms of cells, organisms in terms of organ-systems.\r\nIn this formulation Mechanistic materialism is downward looking, proceeding from\r\nhigher to lower levels of organization in the search for the most general and basic\r\nexplanation.\r\nIn discussing the relationship between parts and wholes, it is sometimes assumed\r\nthat Mechanists have no appreciation of complexity and no interest in how compo-\r\nnents in a system interact to produce an overall effect. This is not the case for most\r\nMechanists. The point of Mechanistic analysis is to identify the components of a\r\ncomplex system in order to understand how they work together in relation to the\r\nwhole. For Mechanists, investigating the components separately reveals their indi-\r\nvidual characteristics in a way that studying them only as part of the whole does\r\nnot. However, it is a tacit assumption of most Mechanists that once the characteris-\r\ntics of each component are known, their relationship to each other and to the whole\r\nwill become apparent. It was a cardinal principle of early twentieth-century Mecha-\r\nnistic philosophy that the properties of living systems can be understood in terms of\r\nthe laws of physics and chemistry, Thus, the lowest level of organization to which\r\nMechanists of that era strove to understand living organisms was that of atoms\r\nand molecules.\r\nIn their attempt to model biology after the physical sciences, Mechanists empha-\r\nsized the importance of experimentation. This was one feature that younger biolo-\r\ngists thought would help place biology on the same footing as chemistry and\r\nphysics. Experimentation allowed the biologist to distinguish between alternative\r\nhypotheses; hypotheses that were incapable of experimental test—for example, that\r\nliving systems were organized by a non-chemical, non-physical \u0001vital\u0002 force—were\r\nconsidered worthless. Experimentation thus served as a corrective against unbridled\r\nspeculation.\r\n2.2.

Holistic biologists sought to provide an\r\napproach that differed from what they saw as the piecemeal, oftentimes naı̈ve and\r\noversimplistic views (especially of organisms) promoted by Mechanists. In the early\r\ntwentieth century two categories of holistic thinking can be discerned: materialistic\r\nand non-materialistic, though the two were often conflated. Among the former are\r\nincluded holistic materialism and dialectical materialism, and among the latter \u0001vital-\r\nism\u0002.

Vitalism was regarded by early twentieth-century mechanistic materialists such\r\nas Jacques Loeb, T. H. Morgan or Wilhelm Roux as fuzzy-minded and subjective\r\nnonsense that offered no concrete research agendas, and provide no real guidelines\r\nfor practical investigation.\r\nGilbert and Sarkar (2000) have pointed out that even though other versions of\r\nholistic thinking in the early twentieth century shared with Mechanism a strictly\r\nmaterialist epistemology, they were nonetheless largely ignored or rejected because\r\nthey were perceived as keeping \u0001very bad company\u0002—either with vitalism of one sort\r\nor another, Nazi \u0001organicism\u0002, or Marxist dialectical materialism—all of which ad-\r\nvanced some kind of holistic view (Gilbert & Sarkar, 2000, pp. 4–5).2 Yet, in sub-\r\nstance, holistic materialism, and the formally-developed sub-category, dialectical\r\nmaterialism, stand in sharp contrast to vitalism in not postulating any forces that\r\ncannot be understood in terms of the known laws of physics and chemistry. What\r\nunited all forms of holism was the clear recognition that living organisms were capa-\r\nble of activities that had no counterpart in the machine world: self-replication, pur-\r\nposeful or ordered response to stimuli, elaborate self-regulatory capabilities, and the\r\nincredible efficiency of their energy transduction. To understand these complex inter-\r\nactive processes, it was necessary to get beyond the individual parts to look somehow\r\nat the whole system or process. In the period 1900–1940, finding methods—concep-\r\ntual and experimental— to accomplish these investigations was a major goal of\r\nholistically-oriented, but materialist biologists (including the embryologists Hans\r\nSpemann, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Joseph Needam and Paul Weiss, and the genet-\r\nicist Richard Goldschmidt).\r\nAs part of their opposition to mechanistic thinking, holistic materialists empha-\r\nsized the importance of distinguishing between levels of organization in a complex\r\nsystem (in studying organisms this could include the atomic, molecular, cellular, tis-\r\nsue, organ-system, organismic, population, or ecosystem levels), proceeding to inves-\r\ntigate each level on its own terms. The holistic approach does not preclude starting\r\nwith a reductionist, analytical breakdown of a complex system into its component\r\nparts, but it does emphasize that this is not enough. For example, in studying the\r\nfunction of the mammalian kidney holistic materialists might first determine all of\r\nthe tissue and cell types of which the kidney is composed. These might be studied\r\ninitially in isolation using methods of histology, cytology and cell physiology. How-\r\never, holistic materialists argue that it would also be necessary to study the whole,\r\nfunctioning where its response to variables such as blood pressure, ion concentration\r\nand hormones could be revealed. Studying one-by-one the ten or so individual cell\r\ntypes that make up the kidney could not be expected to provide a full picture of\r\nhow the kidney functions as a whole within the intact organism.

As\r\nhe wrote: \u0001I consider the chief value of the experiments : : : to be the fact that\r\nthey transfer the problem of fertilization from the realm of morphology into\r\nthe realm of physical chemistry\u0002 (ibid., p. 332). Others soon showed that purely\r\nphysical stimuli, such as pricking the egg with a needle, could also initiate parthe-\r\nnogenesis. These were all positive confirmations that life could be understood by\r\nemploying the concepts of physics and chemistry, and testing them empirically by\r\ncontrolled experiments. Loeb\u0002s interest in this work was not in finding the oper-\r\native mechanism by which fertilization actually triggered development, but rather\r\nin demonstrating that living processes followed the laws of physics and chemistry,\r\nand through proper experimental investigation could be brought under human\r\ncontrol. Operative mechanisms might be interesting for someone to work out in\r\ndetail, but that was not Loeb\u0002s primary focus. He was not so much motivated\r\nto reduce fertilization to one specific physico-chemical process (though he would\r\nhave been interested in any such attempt). Rather, his interest was to demonstrate\r\nthat the process was not beyond investigation by physico-chemical means, and\r\nmost important, not beyond manipulation through experimentation. Science rep-\r\nresented progress for Loeb precisely because it led to control, to the engineering\r\nof nature. As he said in 1903:\r\nWe cannot allow any barrier to stand in the path of our complete control and\r\nthereby understanding of the life phenomena. I believe that anyone will reach\r\nthe same view who considers the control of natural phenomena as the essential\r\nproblem of scientific research. (Loeb, 1903, p. 25, quoted in Pauly, 1987, p.\r\n114)Control of nature could only be accomplished, in Loeb\u0002s view, by banishing all\r\nthose medievalisms that had held humanity back for so long: superstition, mysticism,\r\nmetaphysics and the belief in vitalistic, non-physical, non-chemical forces. The\r\n\u0001mechanistic conception of life\u0002 represented this confluence of ideologies that guided\r\nLoeb throughout most of his career. For his work on parthenogenesis, Loeb was\r\nnominated in 1901 by over a hundred individuals in ten countries for the first Nobel\r\nPrize in physiology or medicine (Fleming, 1964, p. xxiv; Pauly, 1987, p. 101).\r\nBy the time he came to Rockefeller University in 1910, Loeb\u0002s program in\r\nmechanistic science had solidified, and was one from which he would not retreat.\r\nFor the remainder of his career (he died in 1924) Loeb focused more and more of\r\nhis attention on the properties of colloids, particularly those of large molecules such\r\nas proteins or \u0001nucleins\u0002 (i.e. nucleic acids), which he felt held the key to life at the\r\nphysico-chemical level (Pauly, 1987, p. 116). The nucleic acids, like some proteins,\r\nwere capable of autocatalysis—that is, they seemed to act like enzymes for their\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-04T18:31:32.983Z","citation":"","pageIndex":12,"uniqueId":"AllMechanism05","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[AllMechanism05]] AllenG - 2005 - Mechanism, vitalism and organicism in late nineteenth and twentieth-century biology - the importance of historical context.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[AllMechanism05]] AllenG - 2005 - Mechanism, vitalism and organicism in late nineteenth and twentieth-century biology - the importance of historical context.pdf","modified":"2022-08-04T18:31:32.987Z","created":"2022-08-04T18:31:32.983Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"123f0c84-2ee6-4f3c-b5cf-9f9020d8236c","extra":"","modified":"2022-08-04T19:16:17.000+00:00","created":"2022-08-04T18:31:33.012+00:00","text":"Loeb\u0002s Mechanistic view was cast in the reductionist language of physics and\r\nchemistry.

In this sense he\r\nwas content to have a reproducible experimental system that gave him the power\r\nto analyze causal relationships in tissue organization and differentiation, and at those\r\nlevels to develop testable hypotheses.\r\nThe interesting lesson from this brief examination of Spemann in relation to the\r\ndevelopment of mechanistic philosophy, however, is the degree to which, at the\r\ntime, any holistic approach might be easily seen as a step toward vitalism. As a\r\nresult, many biologists failed to see holistic approaches (even those that were con-\r\nsciously materialistic and causal–analytical) as fruitful avenues for research. For\r\nexample, although an embryologist by training, T. H. Morgan paid relatively little\r\nattention to Spemann\u0002s work in his later writings, even those about embryology.\r\nMorgan was even ill-at-ease with aspects of Loeb\u0002s Organism as a whole, claiming\r\nthat some remarks in the book would \u0001be welcomed by just such people who\r\nwould like to believe that : : : the more fundamental problems of nature are quite\r\nuntouched by mechanistic principles\u0002 (he was referring here to some on Loeb\u0002s dis-\r\ncussions of Mendelian genetics) (Pauly, 1987, p. 137). It was in this climate that\r\nmechanistic materialism was being developed in the early twentieth century, and\r\nit is in part this \u0001climate\u0002 that often pushed proponents of Mechanism toward\r\nmore extreme and hardened claims. At the time, any nod toward holistic thinking\r\nwas seen as a slippery slope that would lead inevitably to metaphysics and\r\nvitalism.5. Conclusion\r\nIn this paper I have tried to characterize the \u0001mechanistic conception of life\u0002 that\r\ngained a considerable following in the life sciences during the early years of the\r\ntwentieth century and distinguish it from contemporaneous holistic or organicist\r\n","publicationDate":"2022-08-04T18:31:33.074Z","citation":"","pageIndex":18,"uniqueId":"AllMechanism05","uniqueIdNote":"Zotero Citekey","filePath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading\\[R] [[AllMechanism05]] AllenG - 2005 - Mechanism, vitalism and organicism in late nineteenth and twentieth-century biology - the importance of historical context.pdf","dirPath":"D:\\Dropbox\\NEra\\New_Core_Reading","fileName":"[R] [[AllMechanism05]] AllenG - 2005 - Mechanism, vitalism and organicism in late nineteenth and twentieth-century biology - the importance of historical context.pdf","modified":"2022-08-04T18:31:33.077Z","created":"2022-08-04T18:31:33.074Z","cards":[]}},{"id":"4c4c1df7-8e57-4195-b14f-a5aa792f916e","extra":"","modified":"2022-08-04T19:13:27.000+00:00","created":"2022-08-04T18:31:33.092+00:00","text":"positions.

As biology\r\nhas begun to supplant physics as the pre-eminent science of the day, its philosophical\r\nunderpinnings are not only becoming more sophisticated, but also less rigid. There is\r\nthus a greater need and opportunity for philosophy and biology to form a more\r\ninteractive partnership, at the research bench and in the classroom, than ever before.\r\nIt is my hope that through collective, interdisciplinary efforts, such as the conference\r\nthat gave rise to this issue, such interactions will become increasingly frequent in the\r\nyears ahead.References\r\nAllen, G.
